You can select from various maps that range from night maps, day-time maps, a snow/blizzard map and more. All of our maps feature a dynamic lighting system that will challenge you by darkening the experience over time as the Wraith become stronger and the sun sets on the horizon. \n\nExperience increasing difficulty as different types of Wraith begin to appear over time; watch as they crawl out of the ground to kill you with an overall increase in health as the game progresses. Test yourself or your friends in the ultimate survival experience developed by one person for all.\n\nHow long will you last?",

The museum includes pieces by Rembrandt, Aelbert Cuyp, Frans Hals and many more Old Masters from the Dutch Golden Age.\n\nWalk around a fantastic new space, where the balance between traditional museums and VR is represented through a new sort of architecture. Be sure to check out Rembrandt’s “old man with a turban”, walk through it, and see the original back of the panel, to explore the work’s unique stamps of provenance.\n\nDesigned by architect Johan van Lierop, Founder of Architales and developed by MOYOSA MEDIA from the Netherlands, the museum features 74 Dutch and Flemish Old Master paintings from the Dutch Golden Age, and is  accessible exclusively through VR.\n\nHistory and future of the power of art combined. Get up close and personal with the paintings, examine brushwork and colors in great detail, and listen to George & Ilone Kremer - the founders of the collection - explain what is special about each painting.\n \nGeorge Kremer: “Our journey as collectors has always been about finding the highest quality artworks and simultaneously finding ways to share them with as many people as possible. My wife Ilone and I believe we can make a greater contribution to the art world by investing in technology rather than in bricks and mortar for our collection.”\n\n“First there were museums, then private museums and now  virtual reality privately owned museums are entering the scene” Melanie Gerlis, Financial Times\n\n“Virtual Reality Museum Puts Rembrandt in High-Def” - Molly Schuetz, Bloomberg - \n\n“The Newest Home for Rembrandt and the Dutch Masters Is Gorgeous Outer-Space Museum” -  Brian Boucher, artnet\n\n“At the new Kremer Museum, the lighting is perfectly optimized to accentuate the colors, brushstrokes, and details in each painting” - Sarah Burke Artsy\n\n“By far the best VR experience I’ve seen so far” - Nikolaus Weil, Entrepreneur (Mindex, SingularityU Germany) & Film Producer - Earth and Deep Blue",

As soon as you don the head gear, you are transported to authentic environments with real shotgun physics. You aim your shotgun, pull the trigger, and blast the clay! \n\nClazer uses technology, patented by LeadTech, that teaches you the proper way to lead a target so you can accurately hit it. Real physics are integrated that actually simulate the ballistics of various types of shot. Professional sport shooters have already provided enthusiastic feedback. Clazer is so accurate that it will improve your ability to shoot real targets using an actual shotgun.\n\nClazer includes three separate sport shooting types: \nSkeet\nTrap\nFive Stand Sporting Clays\n\nYou have access to a practice mode that helps to better visualize missed shot trajectory. Competition modes for Skeet, Trap, and Five Stand integrate professional rules and guidelines. \n\nComing Soon: \nLeadTech is working on a solution that will support the use of peripheral guns and real guns in Clazer - In VR!",

            "title": "BattleSky VR - Early Access",
            "desc": "Multiplayer VR flying FPS game - EARLY ACCESS\nBattleSky VR is a Multiplayer VR shooter game at its core, bringing Overwatch style gameplay to the VR platform. Each player picks a Hero with vastly different size, powers and gameplay style to engage in fast-paced aerial combats against other players. Play online against other players with classic Team Deathmatch, Team Escort, Free For All, Attack and Defend, and other team based modes of up to 4v4 players! Pick your Heroes wisely, your unique powers will determine gameplay strategies as you team up to defeat the opponents!\n\nSingle Player Mission Mode\nEach Hero has a single player mission mode where you'll learn the back story about the Heroes, and get familiar with the controls and the unique Flying Locomotion.\n\nCo-Op Mode\nWe will be building some unique Co-op experience to complete a mission with your friends against AI!\n\nUnique VR Locomotion\nThe game’s unique hyper-speed flying locomotion mechanisms had been tested by over 500 testers, and has been fine-tuned to allow nausea-free extreme high speed flying (imagine flying at 250 km/h). Less than 5% of the testers had experienced motion sickness.  With 4 (or more) heroes planned for the game by the time we exit Early Access, players will be sure to find a hero that matches their play style.\n\nWhich Hero do you want to be?\nAt beginning of early Access, two Heroes will be accessible: Draco, and Jet-9. The third Hero is Lady V, and it is being developed. Will you flap your wings to soar through the sky as Draco? Or, zoom through the sky with the hand thrusters as Jet-9? As we develop the game further during Early Access, we look forward to YOUR feedback and suggestions as we add more Heroes.\n\nOur Ultimate Goal\nOur goal is to create a Multiplayer VR FPS game that will define a new generation of e-Sport. We hope to co-create with YOU a game that has depth, encourages strategic gameplay, and is just awesome and unlike any other experiences on VR. Please see the \"Early Access\" section for what content we plan to complete by the time we exit Early Access.VRThis game requires a VR system. The game will initially only support HTC Vive when we start Early Access. The game works with Oculus but may be trick for those without the 3-sensor 360 setup for oculus.\n\nWhy Early Access?\nWe are still developing this game.  We are working with an unique VR experience, with many Heroes to choose from, each with a different type of VR locomotion and gameplay style. We are also working with flying and aerial combat, which is very rare in a FPS multiplayer game. These poses some challenges but also a lot of potential for an awesome new gaming experience.  A lot of this is quite experimental, so we want to engage the gaming community during Early Access to get your feedback, to create more Heroes, locomotion mechanisms, Maps, and Gameplay Modes as we develop the game continuously. We look forward to your feedback and help us shape this unique VR game.  We also hope to raise some money from Early Access so we can expand our team to speed up the development process.\n\nApproximately how long will this game be in Early Access?\naround 6-12 months.\n\nHow is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?\nOur goal is to create a Multiplayer VR flying FPS game that will define a new generation of e-Sport. We hope to co-create a VR game with YOU that has depth, encourages strategic gameplay, and is just awesome and unlike any other experiences in VR currently. \n\nWe plan to achieve the following by the time we launch the game officially:\n-4 Heroes to choose from (or more, if we can get interesting suggestion from the community)\n-4 Missions (each featuring a Hero's back story)\n-6 maps or more for Multiplayer PvP (up to 8 players)\n-More Multiplayer game modes that we will develop together with the community\n-Available for Vive, Oculus, and Windows MR.\n-We might explore cross-platform gameplay with non-VR players.\n\n”What is the current state of the Early Access version?\n-2 completely playable Heroes: Draco, and Jet-9.\n-1 Single Player Mission.\n-Single Player timed race mode (for the 2 maps).\n-Co-Op Escort mode (escort the airship and defend against AI).\n-2 maps for Multiplayer PvP (up to 8 players)\n-Multiplayer Game Modes: Free For All, Big Race, Team Escort\n-HTC vive is fully supported. Oculus is playable but may be tricky to use without the 360 3-sensor setup.\n\nWill the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?\nWe are selling the game really cheap at beginning of Early Access! We will raise the price incrementally as we ship new content updates. Get the game now! The low price will not stay long and price will definitely go up!",

So what’s cool? Students will learn to program robots in the interactive Robolympiad. Enter instructions and see the path - ordered or crazy - your robot takes.\n\nOur field trip visits one of the top high school robotics team in the country as they build their robot and prepare for competition. In fact, we get into the cage with the robot as it takes it’s commands from the students and experience the robot up close.\n\nSometimes humans get a little help from machines. Wendy Martin is our national runner-up teacher of the year and she explores the concept of prosthetics: artificial limbs and human parts. \n\nThen you will enter the liquid surround display as we learn the science behind helmets, why and how they protect our heads. Forces and physics are a key part of this 360 surround experience. \n\nAs always, VictoryVR learning is fun, immersive and amazing. At the same time, our curriculum specialist is meticulous about making sure each lesson is tied to a national science standard as created through the Next Gen Science Standards. \n\nWe have 48 units covering every area of middle and high school science. If you plan to learn science, might as well do it in virtual reality.",

Don’t be afraid of the dinosaurs...they’re mostly friendly. \n\nWendy the science teacher takes us - in full 360 virtual reality - to Crater Lake National Park with Wizard Island nearby, to understand how craters impacted the world around us. \n\nAnd take a dune buggy ride with Steve, your VictoryVR host, through Silver Lake Sand Dunes. It’s a wild ride as you fly over the sand dunes and see how sand on the East coast of Lake Michigan is overtaking homes. \n\nThe stories take you back to the beginning of the universe as it explodes into life and follow earth’s formation from the age of volcanoes to the modern era.\n\nAs always, VictoryVR is fun and amazing, but students learn science while they are immersed inside it. Each unit is tied to Next Gen Science Standards which are the national standards that 19 states have adopted while another 20 are considering",

In virtual reality, the water cycle comes alive as you are immersed in it’s vast capabilities. \n\nAs always, Wendy the Science Teacher provide a fun lesson in science and ecology. Not enough fun? Well, enter Trickybeard’s Cave and challenge the ol’ pirate to a game with his treasure chests.  It’s your memory against his clock for all the treasure he has. \n\nWe have one more movie to experience as a variety of dogs give us a tour of how the Earth’s crust was formed. In fact, we learn that the ground underneath us is constantly moving, even if we don’t realize it. \n\nFor teachers and parents, this unit is fun, but it also covers multiple Next Gen Science Standards on the top of Earth Systems in the Earth & Space category. This unit includes 3 built-in assessments.\n\nCheck out our website at http://www.victoryvr.biz/!",

Create life-sized machines as tall as you can reach, then send them whirling, flinging, and trundling off to solve puzzles on the other side of a floating island. Your task is simple: get the squishy purple ball to that goal off in the distance, or above you, or on the other side of that gap. And your tools are elegantly minimalist: spinning wheels and stretchable rods. But the solutions are endless, and there are no right or wrong ones. We've designed this game from the ground up for room-scale VR. Come immerse yourself in a strange skybound archipelago and befriend Neko the photosynthesizing cat. Build contraptions with your own two hands, life sized and as big as horses, right there in front of you. Play with the physics, juggle pieces, throw darts, and feel another world all around you.",

The invasion of Normandy is over. The fiercest firefights of the war have just begun. Front Defense immerses players in the role of an Allied Forces hero fighting the last relentless onslaught by the Axis in a fictional European town. Hunker down behind well-armed positions as you duck, dive, switch and reload weapons, throw grenades, and man-mounted guns to fight back the enemy assault. Use heavy weaponry against increasingly brutal enemy soldiers, arm the Bazooka or call in airstrikes against armored cars and heavy tanks, and man the thunderous 50-Cal to take down suicidal Stuka dive bombers. From the opening salvo, Front Defense uses the power of VR and the precision of Vive’s room-scale to deliver one of the most intense war shooter experiences ever created.\n\nKey Features:\n• Experience an intense WWII shooter as never before in a superbly polished game designed explicitly for Vive’s room-scale VR and precision tracking\n• Defend strategic positions in a beautifully detailed European town slowly being destroyed by a brutal enemy\n• Seamlessly switch between a variety of weapons, from light and heavy firearms to mounted machine guns\n• Use Bazookas, grenades or call in airstrikes to take on an entire armored division, from well-armed infantry to armored cars, tanks and dive bombers\n• Take on the mysterious Axis super weapon in an epic boss fight finale\n• Increasingly challenging stages and global leaderboards deliver hours of game play and high replay value",

            "desc": "In a Galaxy far, far away… Ditch the golf clubs, because this planetary physics puzzler is like no other.\n\nGalaxy Golf has innovative controls designed specifically for the Vive’s motion tracked wands. You’ll physically spin the planet, grab the ball, and draw your shot arc out into space. Aiming will feel intuitive and natural – but scoring under par will challenge even the best.\n\nBegin with Pleasant Hills and enjoy a mellow course with a pastoral vibe. Survey each planet from the sky, and plan out your path. Will you play it safe, or launch your ball into orbit chasing a hole-in-one?\n\nTake it up a notch and test your skills on the terrible terrains of Frosty Brimstone. Battle gravity to new heights through its harrowing hellscape of glaciers and infernos, in challenges inspired by puzzlers and platformers.\n\nNot enough you say? Hungry for a hardcore challenge? Take off the training wheels and turn on Pro mode. But don’t say we didn’t warn you.\n\nWill you crush the final volcano? Will you cry into your headset? Will you earn a high five? These are important questions you need answers to.\n\nThis is your galactic quest, should you choose to accept it.\n\nGood Luck.",

Not everything seems to be working as expected... you might just have to do some construction work yourself, or even nick some equipment from that canceled base jump event on the roof...\n\nEscape!VR -Above the Clouds- is an 'Escape The Room' genre game which was inspired by real-life escape games and written from the ground up as a room-scale virtual reality experience.\n\nYour goal: Escape! - by solving over a dozen puzzles, which require you to apply logical thinking, discover clues, find and use the correct objects, and -last but not least- having the courage to do slightly crazy things.\n\n'Above the Clouds' is the second installment of the Escape!VR series and has all-new rooms and puzzles and is longer, larger and more challenging than the first game, Escape!VR -The Basement-.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Explore three distinct areas with a total of over 800 square meters, and more than 250 items to interact with.\n* The game is designed for room scale and features a teleporting system. Look, feel, and ambience of the game are based on corresponding real-life environments.\n* In case you get stuck, a built-in hint system provides you with clues. You’ll also get in-game statistics about your performance. \n\nWill you take on the challenge? Will you manage to escape - above the clouds?",

You will be Shooting, dodging and catching everything from bullets, arrows and even meteors to use as weapons against the baddies. All missions are re-playable and vary from casual to extreme as you take on lots of enemies at once. The mission type varies between shootouts and assassination missions with branching paths. You have powers such as super speed, teleport and the ability to use almost everything in reach as a weapon, including bullets! That's right, when the baddies are shooting at you don't forget to grab or deflect their bullets, arrows and meteors. In the initial release you will go to the Wild West and Feudal Japan to stop some bad gangs. This does not go without consequence as the butterfly effect can create ripples such as a zombie outbreak and dinosaur attacks.",

Your goal is to earn 100% of the possible \"conversation\" and \"look-at\" points by talking to the locals and seeing the historically important sights.\n\nYou start on a bustling street corner where you get aquainted with the game's characters and gameplay, then board the trolley car and ride what was North America's northernmost trolley car system, down the famous Whyte Avenue. Experience the hair raising commute of a 1915 passenger as your trolley rumbles across the iconic 137 feet (46M) high, \"High Level Bridge\". Hang on to something as you share the bridge with a locomotive that rumbles past your trolley whose tracks are on the edge of the bridge. Look out your window down over the edge if you dare!\n\nEarn points by talking to various historically themed characters that you are sharing a ride with. People such as the stalwart conductor, gruff coal miner, aloof rich woman, optimistic upper class gentleman, and more. Get those characters to direct you to look at landmarks to learn about the events of the day in 1915 Edmonton. Earn points when you look in the direction of the arrow that appears, pointing you towards the historical landmark.\n\nThis historically accurate first person POV game is fun for people in Edmonton who will recognize many of the buildings still here a century later, as well as entertaining for anyone interested to learn about this bustling and progressive frontier city. To earn 100% (26 conversation points and 6 landmark viewing points) one cannot help but learn a bit of city and era history. Can you get a perfect score? Play it again, until you do.\n\nIncluded in this purchase is a game with high replay value, that is divided up into 3 main levels of increasing difficulty. In the first level you are on the street where you have no time limit to learn how to operate the game before boarding the trolley, then in the second two levels as you ride the trolley you only have the length of the ride to talk to everyone and see everything before you arrive at the legislature building in downtown Edmonton. This VR game is intended to be played on your HTC Vive. Talk to the characters by getting close enough to them and then pressing the talk button on the hand held controller(s) if they have a voice cloud above their heads, and follow their instructions to look along at sites directed by the flashing arrow icons that appear.",

            "desc": "Echo Grotto is a virtual reality experience that lets you explore unique and intricate cave systems using a range of caving gear and tools!\n\nTraverse underwater tunnels, huge open caverns, crystal caves, massive ravines, sulfur pools, deep pits, glow-worm lit grottos and much more!\n\nEcho Grotto uses subtle random generation to make every cave system feel unique, while still delivering amazing locations and deeply interconnected caves since every cavern and passage is handmade and uniquely designed.\nEach time you embark down into the caves of Echo Grotto you will never know what’s around the corner!\n\nBefore you descend into a new cave system you can choose what gear you want to take with you. You might choose another locomotion method (like a grappling hook) or maybe an additional light source like a headlamp or lantern. \nMaybe you would rather take a snorkel with you so that you can reach the underwater portions of the caves? Or maybe a flare gun to easily light up things in the distance. \nThere are many different tools to choose from!\n\nYou can explore the caves using a unique teleportation system, where you throw a small ‘teleporter lamp’ and you will be teleported to where it lands. This lamp will leave a trail of previous lamps behind you, resulting in a trail of lights that leads you back the way you came! \nMuch like how cavers would leave a string behind them as they go, your teleporters leave a wire and trail of lights for you to retrace your steps.\n\nAnother locomotion option is a pair of caving hooks, which you can use to freely \"grab and move\" yourself around the environment!\n\nChoose to play as either an 'experience' or a 'game'. Choosing 'experience' will allow you to pick whatever gear you want from the start and simply explore the caves as you wish, while choosing 'game' will include a progression system, where you start with only basic tools and must search for more within the caves. \nIt also employs a simple currency system, where you can use various gemstones found within the caves to get better tools!\n\nYou can also play a range of special ‘scenarios’ which alter the gameplay in unique ways. For example, you can explore a flooded cave system, start the game from an alternative entrance or play with nothing but glowsticks! \nSome scenarios are like special challenges, like starting the game already deep into a cave system with only a candle (which will run out over time!).\n\nYou will also find a range of cave-dwelling creatures in Echo Grotto.\nKeep an eye out for snails, eels and wetas! But if you’re not a fan of creepy-crawlies you can always set which animals can be found in the caves (or even none at all).\n\nGo and see for yourself what’s deep in the caves of Echo Grotto!",

You'll never reach an edge, because there aren't any. \n- Choose from 750+ marker color and thickness combinations.\n- Nothing is permanent: either use the built-in eraser to clear an area on the board or use undo and redo to erase recent strokes. \n- Markers provide haptic feedback while drawing and feature adjustable marker smoothing to help you write legibly.\n- Import images (JPG/PNG/TIFF/GIF/BMP/ICO) and arrange them on the whiteboard. Use them to create moodboards, do homework assignments, prepare presentations, or even to do code reviews. \n- The perfect study space: import PDF course material, grab a virtual marker, and shut yourself off from all outside distractions. You can even record your homework sessions to share them with your classmates and the world using the interactive desktop view and recording software of your choice. \n- Export your drawings as SVG images and view them in the browser when you're not in VR, import them into your office suite, or share them with your team. Also useful for recording your own signature for embedding in documents or emails.",

Pedestrian Street\n2. Music Pub\n3. Roadside Stage\n4. Space Stage\nNote: More scenes are under building and will be added in the future updates!\n\nCool Tracks (Most with 3 or more difficulties):\n1. Hills Behind - Pop\n2. To the Top - Pop\n3.

            "desc": "In a twisted world best described as ”a miniature cardboard city turned into a malicious science experiment”, you find yourself captured against your will by an oddly charming but mysterious YouTuber that goes by the name \"Sven\" in the deadly city of Kartong. Your life now depends on mediocre office supply-weapons and your every move is being filmed for his YouTube enjoyment - a truly odd experience, all wrapped up in challenging stealth/FPS gameplay. And oh, did we mention that you’re shrunk to the size of a toilet paper roll? Yes, you’re small... very small.\n\nKartong - Death by Cardboard! combines the cuteness of scary toys with the charm of paper cuts - all wrapped up in challenging miniature/stealth/FPS gameplay (that’s a legit genre, right?).\n\nNew Progression and Skins!\nNo worries, no loot boxes here! However, to upgrade your crossbow you need Robo-Coins. These coins can be obtained by smacking some robot-butt! Each time you slay a robot they will drop coins that can be gathered to upgrade your crossbow throughout the game. Hasta la vista, baby!\n\nLife never gets easier!\nSo, you managed to find your way out of the city? Well, it ain't over yet pal. Kartong’s many difficulty levels will push you to the limit of your own madness. We would say “Prepare To Die”, but that’s a bit cliche now ain’t it?\n\nBecome the ultimate maze-warrior!\nKartong features a a local high score system for each difficulty as well, with seeds to control the map. So now you can challenge friends for the best scores, get the sweetest upgrades and show off your rarest loot!\n\nYou like watching them and so do we!\nWith Kartong we’ve figured out a way to put your favorite influencers into the deadly cardboard world! Custom-made “Co-Labs”-maps will monthly feature different highlights that you can easily enter and play to your heart's content.\n\nA game jam gone horribly wrong!\nAfter launching our previous title SVRVIVE: The Deus Helix, our dev team held a \"lets-go-bonkers\" game jam to blow off some steam. Obviously troubled by some very disturbing thoughts (disclaimer: we blame office air pollution), our team came up with Kartong. And once conceived, we had no choice but to bring yet another unpronounceable game to the world.",

            "desc": "The Story\n\nIn 2016, The NASA New Horizons space probe identified a fleet of alien ships heading towards Earth. Having tracked the many previous sightings and abductions taking place over the years, world leaders have determined that the approaching fleet are sinister in nature. It is projected that their fleet will arrive sometime in late 2017.\n \nIn response to this global crisis, the US military was forced to disclose a top secret military project they had created during the Cold War. The DH125 is a military defense robot that was secretly deployed into orbit during the US Star Wars Initiative. The DH125 is unique in that it contains alien components retrieved from the Roswell crash in 1947 and is the only weapon we have to defend our planet.\n \nThe DH125 was secretly retrieved and modernized to prepare us to defend our planet. It is the only defense we have and can only be remotely operated by one person. Now the global leaders of the world have declared a world emergency and have initiated a program to find the one person capable of manning the DH125. World leaders have called upon VR Visio to create a simulation designed to test a person’s skills, reflexes and precision.\n \nAre you the one who will lead us to victory? Do you have the skills to defend our planet? Download the game on Steam now and find out if you are the one.\n\n\nKey features:\n- Deadly bosses \n- Hordes of enemies\n- Dynamic, highly immersive gameplay\n- Interesting plot\n- Lot’s of fun!",

Then step into the portal and begin!\n\nEons ago, dragons roamed freely across the lands of Reigndar, living in harmony with nature and magic. \nWhen humans found the portal to cross into to this dimension a war over the magical resources soon followed. After decades, one victor emerged - the evil sorcerer Lord Ghastur. Even with his powers weakened, Lord Ghastur started his work to imprison the free spirited dragons by separating their spirits from their physical bodies which he used to tap the remaining mana reserves. The dragons put up a good fight but Lord Ghastur's powers were too great. Only one dragon - Ryaver the Crimson managed to re-open the dimensional portal to the human world to call for help, before being imprisoned himself. \n\nYou have heard the call. Your goal is to release as many dragons as possible by merging the prisons of body and spirit into one. Move fast, time is short!\n\n* Start your chosen chapter in the Starting Lobby by grabbing one of the Orbs containing your chapter of choice with your right controller. If you've cleared any of the chapters once before you will be able to replay them and start your  journey from there instead of the beginning.\n* Each chapter consists of 5 levels with varying difficulty and puzzles. You have 30 seconds to earn as many points as you can during that time. If a chapter is restarted your Score will be reset, but any experience-points you've earned during that play will continue to count towards your total.\n* When the level starts, grab the Orbs that will appear around you, one for each wand and match the correct colour to join them together and earn points.\n* After a level has been cleared the Scoreboard will show you how well you did and rack up your total score. Dragon Orb features a Global Scoreboard so try to earn as much points as you can and become the ultimate Dragon-savior!\n* After finishing each level, step into the portal (blue, shiny bubbles) and press any of the Trigger buttons to continue.\n* You can access the in-game menu at any time by pressing the Touchpad on your left controller.\n* The Trigger buttons on either controller are designated for ALL Clicks/Continues/Grabs\n\nFeature list\n* Fast-paced arcade/action with classic fun & puzzle-solving gameplay\n* There will be dragons\n* Super easy to get started, with increasingly challenging levels\n* Global Scoreboard; Take on the world & become the ultimate Dragon-savior\n* Room-scale VR; Move freely to solve the puzzles by using your brain & your body\n* Family-friendly; Rated E for everyone\n* Get ready to sweat; Orbs will be spawning all around the play-area\n* Did we mention there will be dragons?",

The game puts you in the shoes, and on the bike, of a child in a nightmare. \nYour objective is to cycle through the unexplored environments of your mind in hopes to survive the night and wake up the next day. \n\nAs you cycle through this VR world you will explore new environments, new creatures and challenges, as well as unlock a variety of bikes worthy of elusive nightmares and cycling demons. And if you want to push yourself even more and test your focus while you slumber and cycle, try the time trial mode where collecting time is the only way to survive. That’s if surviving the nightmare is even an option...\n\nSo how far will you get, and what bikes (maybe not just bikes…) will you unlock to guide you through your gloomy dream. Will you hide in a corner and cry while you wait for the sand man, or will you get on your bike and ride through hell. The choice is yours.\n\nIn the dark blue sky you keep\nAnd often through my curtains peep\nFor you never shut your eye,\n‘til the sun is in the sky...",

Spawning from behind over-sized children’s toys and circus props, clowns from your worst childhood nightmares are coming to get you. Driven by an unimaginable rage, they want nothing more than to claw out your eyes and tear the flesh from your bones. A dark sky and thick fog obscure your view -- only as they close in can their terrifying faces can be seen. Armed with automatic weapons and an endless supply of ammunition, how long you survive is determined only by your accuracy and willingness to kill.\n\nKiller Klownz features full roomscale support and dynamically adjusts its map to fit to your play space. Various types of enemies with varying degrees of speed and strength keep the game action challenging and unpredictable. \n\nDo you have what it takes to survive wave after wave of Killer Klownz?\n\nWARNING: This game is not for the faint of heart. If you truly are afraid of clowns, this may be too intense for you. In testing, multiple players bowed-out within seconds citing extreme anxiety. Players are advised to self-monitor stress-levels.",

Bullet time system, it happens every time the fight begin or when you hurt badly. It’s an excellent time to hit creeps’ vital part and blind sides, and the reloading speed is much quicker too. \n\n9. There’re about two kinds of fight style: with high sneak value and hurt the creep badly in distance if you’re a good shooter; or with high perception value and fight against the creep face to face, but you'd better put on good armor. \n\n10. Some creeps can attack at a wide range, hit their missiles before they hit you.\n2. Weather System, Time System and Season System\n1. There’re sunny, rain, snow, fog and hail 5 kinds of weather in this game. You’d better take care of your currently sanity and warmth. \n2. Daytime, dusk and night 3 stage in time system, some creeps behaviors different in these stages. And at night, you’d better light a fire or something like that. It’ll help you keep away from danger and find out something can’t see in daytime. \n3. And there’re about 4 seasons in this game, and the change is huge.\n3.

Terrain may influence player's attributes.\n\nUnique Experiences\n1. Use 3d printer to create weapons and other stuffs. \n2. Use sewing machine to create clothes. \n3. Creeps can be infected by plantings in summer, be careful. \n4. Egg is a good thing, but it’s dangerous to steal an egg from dodo. \n5. Boar may eat shit, don’t rob it from a boar, or it’ll get angry. \n6. Find batteries from vehicles or create them with lead. \n7.

This is due to what he has invented with energy sources as well as what he was currently working on. Because of these constant threats he has created facilities away from the main training underground facility and hangars, which are sub training areas. This particular area is known as FILE 9. Here, there are multiple programs which include ‘Transport Tunnel’, ‘Drone Evasion’, ‘Infiltrate and Destroy’ and others. Each has specific event possibilities in order to help be prepared and also be able to overcome possible threats when needed. \n\nLorna, learning of her actual grandfather and of his recent disappearing, which comes as news of a huge level to her with the fact she has never known about him with her being adopted and not really knowing anything about her family.

To achieve to runaway, you’ll have to build a raft and face the Ocean’s weaves.\nCan you handle it?\n\nABOUT THE PROJECT\n\nThis will be the first release of the game, further updates are coming soon.\n \nOur desire is to continue working on it, implementing the game with new interactable objects, food, drink, tools, animals and, most of all, we would love to add new islands and the way to move from one to the other.\n\nSo, in this first phase, we will really appreciate \nall your feedback and advices, of any kind, \nthey will help us to develop a better game.",

Each ship includes an \"action\" event, whereby mighty cannons fire, ship horns bellow, or the submarine dives.

            "desc": "MakeVR Pro - Immersive CAD based 3D Content Creation with Precision\n\nWith MakeVR Pro, creating precision 3D content in a virtual environment, whether for 3D printing or import into other applications, has never been easier.\nMakeVR Pro is a CAD based fully immersive 3D content creation experience that provides precision tools that allow objects to snap to grids, rulers, or any other object in the scene and slide over their surfaces, all the while maintaining their depth and angle relative to the surface of the object on which they're tracking.  When you have your objects lined up precisely where you want them, you can perform any of the many Boolean operations that are literally at your fingertips: cut/join/slice/sweep/mirror/etc. \nRulers, grids, and other objects can be snapped together into useful, reconfigurable, assemblies called jigs. For example, a ruler can be snapped onto a grid and dragged laterally about the grid to an exact location. Then an object can be snapped on the ruler enabling the up-down positioning of the object. This combination allows for exact positioning of objects in three dimensions, relative to one another, and provides movement along exact paths for precision cuts or joining.  This lets you model in much the same way carpenters and machinists work in their shops.  Plus, MakeVR’s grids and rulers can be set to either US Standard or the metric system.  \nRotational precision is accomplished through the use of the Porcupine, a widget that provides rotational control of whatever object you’re currently using.  With the Porcupine, objects can be precisely rotated to 45 degree angular values along any axis.  Pull your hand outside of the porcupine for smooth, continuous rotations.\n\nAnd anything you create in MakeVR can be exported -- to share with others, to import into game engines, other CAD packages, 3D modeling applications, or to be 3D printed.\n\nAbout MakeVR\n\nMakeVR is a 3D content creation experience with a natural style of interaction that lets anyone, regardless of age or experience level, step into a professional CAD engine and start building cool 3D objects and worlds on Day One.  MakeVR democratizes content creation through its extremely low learning curve because you use your own two hands as they were meant to be used, with very natural and intuitive interactions.\n\n3D Multi-Touch\n\nWith two independently tracked hands in MakeVR, you can translate (move), scale, and rotate your environment in the same way you use 2D multi-touch on your smartphone, or tablet – but better. You simply reach out and grab a point in space and use that point to drag the entire world around: up, down, left, right, backward, and forward. If you grab two points, you can move your hands closer or further apart to scale the environment up or down and rotate it around you. Scaling in MakeVR is a powerful feature because it allows you to position yourself anywhere in the environment at whatever scale best suits the current task – so you’re always working in your comfort zone.\nMakeVR’s 3D Multi-Touch is the next logical step in the evolution of interfaces, the perfect interface for the next generation of users who already expect a greater level of interaction. It’s a way of interacting with 3D content that is so natural and intuitive anyone can do it.\n\nBuilt-in CAD engine for precision and models with a life beyond MakeVR\n\nMakeVR incorporates a professional CAD engine, giving you all the advanced tools you expect, presented in a way anyone can understand and use; it’s a powerful yet easy way to build precision models while immersed.\nA suite of highly developed Boolean tools, with over 150 man-years of engineering behind them, allow for some very innovative freeform content creation.  Precision alignment of objects in MakeVR is achieved through the use of grids, rulers, jigs, object snapping and tracking, and mirroring, all of which allow for positional and rotational accuracy of your content in the virtual world.\n\n3D printing for everyone\n\nMakeVR is a 3D modeling design system for virtual reality that fully supports all major 3D printing platforms.  And everything created in MakeVR can be saved in a standard 3D printing format, and with a click of a button, sent to either a local 3D printer or to a 3D printing service like Shapeways.\nWith MakeVR, the old challenges of 3D modeling are gone. It frees you from the constraints of complicated, traditional menu-based modeling programs. Imagine being able to physically reach into a 3D scene to grab, interact with, and modify CAD-based solid models just like you manipulate objects in the real world. Now imagine, with the click of a button, sending your creation to a local 3D printer or to a printing service to bring it into the real world. MakeVR allows you to do all of this and more",

My name is Frol Blok and this is the beginning of my story.\n\nFrol Blok - quest-room that is inspired by an old-school quests. Stuffing that is made out of non-linear story, narrative and charismatic protagonist is waiting for you. Independent scientist from snowy Santa-Beria and simply adventurer-opportunist who is always ready to comment out everything with a couple of useful (and not really) one thoughts. At the same time, VR technology enables to add mechanics of climbing, detail examinations of finds and force affect on environment except classical items finding and combination.\n\nIt’s a small game, but if you like it the story will be continued.\n\nKey Features:\n\nNon-linear story.\nBoth endings will be achieved only by the most crazy scientists;\n\nHigh replayability.\nNext try will be much funnier because of generator that will swap the room content randomly;\n\nHigh level of interaction.\nBurn and break, pull and climb, combine and make that work;\n\nNarrative stuffed.\nFrol is a grouchy person, but you will team up. His story and surrounding world have very addictive atmosphere.",

            "desc": "Suit up for the first manned mission to Mars! MARS 2030 is a virtual reality simulation that gives players the opportunity to explore the mysterious red planet like never before. \n\nMARS 2030 centers on open world exploration. Taking on the role of an astronaut, players traverse Mars and collect geological samples that uncover the planet’s past. Make discoveries across 40 square kilometers of open Martian terrain, accurately-mapped and -modeled using NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE satellite data. Along this journey, players discover a world rich in history that, much like our own planet, once looked very different from what exists today. MARS 2030 can also be experienced in non-VR.\n\nKey features include:\n\nFull Martian days, with the orange hues of day transitioning to blue at night\nRealistic weather conditions, atmospheric pressure, and Martian gravity\nGeolab workstation equipped with a VR Microscope to study collected samples\nA habitat base, modeled after the design from NASA Langley’s Evolvable Mars Campaign\nInteractive VR music, performed and recorded by the London Symphonic Orchestra\nAmbisonic sound covers audio sources from every direction and propagates sound realistically\nFull support of motion controls to operate equipment and Mars rover, and navigate the terrain\nCustom-built Unreal 4 game engine capable of producing the large scale environment at optimal frame rates\n\nMars 2030 was developed by FMG Labs, a division of Fusion Media Group, in partnership with NASA. It will be available for HTC Vive, Oculus, and Playstation VR headsets.",

            "desc": "Please note that only .wav and .ogg file are supported on this app. \n\nMint Muse Sound Flare is the industry's first full native VR audio workstation (not plugin) that enables intuitive and WYSIWYG VR audio editing. The VR DAW revolutionizes the iteration process of audio monitoring in VR, which directly improves sound localization and production efficiency.\n\n- A whole new interaction and editing experience:\nMint Muse Sound Flare is the very first DAW built for virtual reality. You can look around your mixing environment and interact with the controls as if you were in a full sound studio. Sound clips can be added to the scene, dropped into the tracks, and then intuitively dragged around in 3D space all with the Vive controllers. \n\n-WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) VR audio editing:\nOnce the sound clips are arranged in the scene as desired, you can press play and listen to what the mix will sound like in full 3D, without ever taking off the Vive headset. If a sound is not coming from the desired location, use the Vive controllers to grab it and move it as needed, and then press play again to immediately test how it sounds in the new location. This 3D audio mixing process is much faster and more efficient than using a plugin for a traditional DAW. Once the mixing is complete, the audio can be saved into a WAV file for future use. \n\nDirect support from Mint Muse’s audio engine and lower level SDK:\nAll sound processing is done in real-time by Mint Muse’s custom 3D audio engine. This engine gives a great sense of 3D presence by moving the audio from inside your head to anywhere in the environment with any standard pair of headphones. Move a clip far to the left or behind and it will really sound as though it is coming from that position. The Mint Muse audio engine does all this processing for you - quickly, efficiently, and with very low latency.",

            "desc": "Description：\n<Mystery Stone from Heaven> is created by Simple Studio and based on UE4 engine. We designed and recomposed a fantastic story based on the history of Shuidonggou that was a national 5A scenic spot. One day in 2008, an archaeologist discovered a fragment from a shinning stone. With curiosity and doubt, he traversed into dream which located on a huge maze made of Grand Canyon in 40,000 years ago (Quaternary Glaciation). Exploring with brave and wisdom, the secrets were uncovered slowly… After finishing the adventure of Paleolithic Period, the archaeologist went into the second dreamland which located on the Great Wall of Ming dynasty (500 Years Ago). The left side of the Great Wall was immense prairie belonged to Tartar of Mongolia and the other side was magnificent ancient city belonged to Ming dynasty. At the meantime, new thrilling challenges emerged…  \n\nYou would learn how to drill wood to make fire to survive, make stone implement, search the ancient roll, kill the wooly rhinoceros, collect the skeletons from an elegant princess and other clues to unravel the spectacle and secret of Shuidonggou. The VR Game was designed elaborately and good for educating. You would not only enjoy the fantastic VR Technology, but also witness the wisdom from our ancestor in Shuidonggou.  \n(Attention: Preventing from getting hurt or harming on others, please do not play VR game with drastically intense and long workouts) \n\n\nFeatures：\nSubtitle：Chinese and English subtitle, Chinese dub. \nMassive Environment：Unique Yadan landform of Shuidonggou, magnificent Great Wall and thrilling Troop-hiding Cave.\nVarious animals from prehistoric age：Saber-toothed Tiger, Mammoth, Wooly Rhinoceros, Deodicurus who had been extincted. \nAbundent Interaction: Drill wood to make fire, hunting Wolly Rhinoceros and collect properties into Bag System. \nCreative Inspiration：Shuidonggou is one of the earliest excavated Paleolithic Sites in China. It is honored as “the birthplace of prehistoric archaeology in China”, “The historical evidence on cultural exchange between China and western countries”. Shuidonggou is also listed as one of “the 100 archaeological discoveries on the most significance about Chinese Civilization ” by China. It is National 5A Tourist Scenic Spot, National Key Cultural Relics Protection Units, National Geological Park. What’s more, Shuidonggou is the most intact three-dimensional system of military defense about the Great Wall in China. Shuidonggou can be literally comprehended as “Water Cave Channel” in Chinese. Because of restless rivers, cave eroded by yellow river and channel formed by flowing stream.",

So, in this unit, enter the rec room and dance with holograms, play a little billiards or just relax and watch some television. Oh, and you might just learn a few things along the way.\n\nWendy, the Science Teacher, gets to play with a Tesla Coil and you go along for the ride. If you don’t know what a Tesla Coil is, we can tell you that it is a shocking experience. \n\nThe Physics Force Field is like no place you’ve ever traveled. It’s a playground where Coulomb’s Law and Newton’s first three laws come alive with giant circus balls, force fields, traction beams and the laws of gravity completely suspended. You will experience the laws of nature in a way that would never be possible in the real world. \n\nFootball and concussions are a big topic of conversation and for our virtual field trip, we travel to Purdue University and discuss the latest science with American football helmets, the forces involved with the sport and actions being taken to better protect athletes using the laws of physics.\n\nFinally, in our story, we learn about the physics in the game of pool as well as how Newton’s laws of motion are an integral part of this game. It’s a fascinating story of action and reaction.",

            "desc": "Survival, horror at the sunless depths of the Pacific Ocean. Stranded on the seafloor with low light and few tools, an industrial diver takes desperate steps to surface before his oxygen — and sanity — give out.\n\nConceived as a student project, this first person survival story unfolds following an industrial catastrophe, from inside a half-ton, high-tech dive suit — a “walking coffin.\" Influenced and inspired by a growing appetite for unconventional horror and narrative-driven games, Narcosis is rooted in reality, but steeped in the surreal.\n\nFeatures:\n+ Pressure Kills: High-stress situations accelerate oxygen intake, distorting sight, sound, space and time.\n+ Hostile Waters: A knife, flashlight and flares are essential to surviving the nightmarish flora and fauna of the abyss.\n+ Phantom Narrative: The survivor’s account unfolds in inexplicable ways alongside the player’s journey.\n+ Beyond Good and Evil: No shadowy organizations or eldritch terrors at Narcosis’ dark heart,  only primal fears and human limits.\nTerror Verite: Primal fears — darkness, confinement and isolation — take on new levels of immersion when experienced in VR.\n\nAbout Honor Code:\nBased in France and California, Honor Code’s collective resume includes such games and series as Assassin’s Creed, Dance Central, Metal Gear Solid, Remember Me, Republique, The Silent Age, and Silent Hill.",

            "desc": "A nostalgia-fuelled first person shoot 'em up inspired by classic arcade games. Save the Earth, burn the Sun.\n\nTo pay off your life debts you’ve been uploaded to one of millions of nano-workbots in the Sun’s core to prevent solar flares by breaking down neon isotopes.\n\nYou control an ion cannon in a 360º gravitationally affected environment, firing positive and negative ions using left & right triggers at incoming neon isotopes of varying ‘charge’ to eliminate them.\n  \nNeon uses a modern day reboot of the classic retro arcade style. Featuring vector polygonal lines and surfaces illuminated by pulsating neon lighting with immersive 360º action.\n\nEach of the 42 levels of the game have been carefully crafted with each formation requiring a different strategy to achieve best times. There’s a solid sense of progression and a steady ramping up of difficulty - ideal for introducing non-gamers to VR but challenging enough for more experienced players. \n\nLevels develop to include stronger gravitational forces, more isotopes, and new kinds of jeopardy. Boss levels with super-structures need new strategies, with a selection of power-ups such as slo-mo, shockwave and solar blossom mode adding to the fun. Your sassy AI sidekick Seren has always got something to say - but is mostly just sarcastic.\n\nUtilising the talents of three music producers (Forward Memory, Dynamix, and I Am Galactic), Neon features an original soundtrack of ambient electronica, synthwave and electro which complements the modern-retro styling of the game.\n\n“It’s like Tron had sex with an atom” - some guy on Reddit",

            "desc": "Cosmos Crash – The first person shooting & puzzle VR game of Viriver Studio is now online.\n\nIn this game, you’ll be a space pilot with your ship trapped by orbits in the depths of the vast universe. By firing high-tech marbles, you need to make matches of three or more same-colored marble in the orbit before it reaches your ship. This early access version contains 10 different orbits waiting for you, think fast and aim smart to solve these problems!\n \nSpatial 3D orbit \nThe 3D spatial orbits are the biggest highlight of Cosmos Crash. Surrounded by various shapes of orbits (crown, pipe, balance, gear, etc)， the game brings you immersive experience as if you are just there in the universe, giving full play to the superiority of virtual reality.\n\nStrategy\nEach of the 10 orbits has different strategies to clear all the marbles. Special orbit like accelerating orbit (speeding up the pass-by marbles) and balance shaped orbit (requires clarity of both side orbit) appears as the game progressed. \n\nSpecial marbles\nIf you're good enough to rack up 3 or more combos, you’ll get special marbles that'll help you on your way. The special effect of that marble depends on the color of the last match you made. You’ll have 6 types of special marbles to choose from.\n\nMoreover\nWe also prepared some fancy extra contents in the gameplay. For example, if you clear particular orbit area, the lanterns around the area will be lit, making the whole universe interesting!",

            "desc": "Paddle Master VR is a cross between a breakout-style game and racquetball, inspired by a popular mobile game (Ballz). You play inside something like a racquetball court, but with numbered blocks that you must destroy. You have a gun that you use to shoot balls at the blocks, and a paddle to keep the balls in play when they bounce back to you. When your balls are all gone, your gun is automatically reloaded, and a new row of blocks appears, and any old blocks are moved closer to you. You lose when any blocks get pushed past the red line marking the front of the play area. Oh, and the balls have a tendency to explode... How long can you last?",

            "desc": "Playthings was made to welcome anyone to the world of virtual reality. Built for the HTC Vive, Playthings puts virtual drumsticks in your hands and sets you loose on a musical playground from another world. There's no complicated buttons or tutorials--everyone knows how to use drumsticks. But drums are for real life. In Playthings, the instruments are made out of food: like hot dog xylophones and jelly bean harps. With the HTC Vive's room scale motion tracking, you don't need a joystick to explore the world of Playthings--you move around with your own two feet. Playthings transforms even the tiniest room into a tropical dreamscape that stretches forever in every direction. You can make all sorts of music with your snacks. Or, you can rearrange them with the Golden Tongs to make your own singing food sculptures. You can swing the Giant Hammers to relieve stress (or just make a big mess). There's lots more tools and worlds to discover--all you have to do is take a look around.\n\nFeatures:\n5 explorable worlds full of interactive musical food that anyone can play.\n3 different pairs of drumsticks with unique powers.\nIntuitive, languageless, tutorial-free controls.\nSecret Rhythm Game mode! (shhh)\nFeatures an original soundtrack written by Jon Baken (of George & Jonathan)\nGuest performance by Jesper Mortensen (aka \"Junior\" of Junior Senior) on the Playthings theme song, \"C'mon Everybody! (Playthings Rap)\"",

Open fire with pistol, shotgun, submachine gun, laser and minigun or wield a weapon from more civilized days.\n\n“Have you ever considered that everything around you might just be a simulation?” (*)\n\nSome target projectiles disappear after one hit, some are more heavily armoured, some will even shoot back at you and some are not to be harmed at all.

A fast-paced, strategic game that became an interplanetary phenomenon, bringing all the Zen together. As an aspiring Zen, you are challenged to join the most prestigious team that dominated the entire competition - the Division of Steel. Are you up for the challenge?\n\nSINGLEPLAYER EXPERIENCE:\nYou’re about to face 4 members of the infamous Division of Steel per Cup. Beware! The higher the Cup, the more demanding and troublesome it gets!\n\nCHALLENGING AI:\nThanks to a particularly advanced Artificial Intelligence in singleplayer, every opponent you’re going to play against will have their own temper and an utterly unique style of play.\n\nEVER-GROWING CHARACTER:\nEnhance your skills and become stronger with every match to be able to challenge the most renowned and agile representatives of the Division of Steel. \n\nMOCAP ANIMATIONS:\nTo deliver the most realistic characters’ movements, we relied upon motion capture data for our animations. The actors participating in the recording were in fact professional table tennis players, which translates each player’s swing into one, fluid motion and makes the rivalry as realistic as possible.\n\nADVANCED PHYSICS:\nAs expected in VR, our aim was to address the simulation aspect of the game to provide the real table tennis experience. We spent countless hours on developing our own physics from scratch. Based on scientific research, it’s extremely realistic and translates your moves in the most accurate manner.\n\nWORKSHOP:\nEach victory provides you with valuable assets that allow you to develop your unique character. The more skillful you become, the more admirable in your rivals’ eyes you become.",

            "desc": "In commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, TIME and LIFE VR take you back to that moment in history in this original historical virtual-reality project. \n\nTold in three acts, the story is told through the point of view of Lt. James Downing, who at 103 is the second-oldest living American veteran to have witnessed that day. As postmaster of the USS West Virginia, Downing gave himself the task of writing letters to the families of men who died or were injured during the attack; those letters form an arc that the user follows through Downing's experience of Dec. 7, 1941. In an American home of 1941, we hear from Downing about how the coming of war affected everyone in the U.S.; at Pearl Harbor after the attack, we see the breadth of the destruction; and in the present day, we learn how the experience has stayed with him for 75 years. Throughout the experience, users interact with realistic virtual versions of artifacts from the time, along with iconic photography and archival video, providing a unique and personal view of one of American history's defining moments. \n\nThis experience was created using resources from the National WWII Museum and the Library of Congress, which provided expertise, artifacts and primary-source references; and with award-winning author and Pearl Harbor expert Craig Nelson as a historical advisor. The experience has been created to be appropriate for audiences of all ages. It was produced by Deluxe VR in partnership with HTC and AMD.",

            "desc": "2,000 years ago, Ephesus served as a lively centre of trade, connecting the cultures of Europe and Asia Minor. Sail on ancient seas, explore unknown worlds, and witness one of the world’s most important ancient sites. Experience it now!\n\nLithodomos VR has painstakingly recreated ancient Ephesus, allowing you to step back in time and explore the city in all of its original splendour and glory. You are a sailor in the 2nd Century AD, and your mission is to deliver precious goods - but your ship is off course, and you must first steer it safely into the harbour. Be careful along the way: piracy is well known in the Roman world.\n\nThis Lithodomos VR experience is not just engaging and entertaining, but is a valuable educational tool of great historical significance. Every detail has been researched and approved and is backed-up by archaeological evidence. If you can’t travel to Turkey, or travel back in time, then this is the most important cultural experience you can have.",

It is vital that you perform this ritual correctly, to guard against evil and gain understanding of your omens.\n\nThis ritual is one of precision using various implements with multiple stages, including music and sacrifice and burnt offerings to the gods.\n\nThe user will be guided through, and get to participate in this historic ritual. \n\nThis Lithodomos VR experience is not just engaging and entertaining, but is a valuable educational tool of great historical significance. Every detail has been researched and approved and is backed-up by archaeological evidence.\n\nFun Facts: Construction began during the reign of Emperor Claudius (41-54 AD) and ended some forty years later, during the reign of Emperor Domitian (81-96 CE). The remains of the Roman temple stand next to the town hall in Cordoba. The size of the building needs to be seen to be believed. You have seen the altar in the Lithodomos VR experience, and you will stand in amazement below the marble columns that support the roof.",

It's entirely up to you.\n\n• Keep upgrading your abilities and weapons as you accumulate experience from completing missions. Become the true ninja warrior hero you've always wanted to be.\n\n• Traverse a reimagined futuristic Japan in unique oriental locations.\n\n• Soak yourself in blood-pumping, exhilarating music as you become God in your own action movie.\n\n\n-SPECIAL RECORDING FEATURE - \n\n• Record your game play in 3rd-person perspective.

            "desc": "Step into your very own Virtual Reality Planetarium! Star Chart lets you explore the solar system and night sky in a beautiful and accurate real-time simulation.\n\nWe're proud to bring to you the hugely successful astronomy & star gazing app - Star Chart - downloaded by over 20 million people world-wide.\n\nDelight in exploring the solar system, from the Sun to the smallest moons of Saturn and out to the coldest, darkest, farthest reaches of Pluto. Gaze down and marvel at our solar system from above. Look up in wonder at the rings of Saturn. Feel the awe of floating in space around worlds no human has yet set foot on. Understand how the constellations of our night sky are made up of stars distant to each other in both space and time. Embrace the impossible distances of our solar system and the inordinate scale of our universe.\n\nStar Chart currently includes:\n- Explore Mode: A 3D solar system to explore, including the Sun, the planets, major moons and more\n- Sky View: An accurate real-time simulation of the night sky as you see them from your own GPS coordinates.\n- NEW! Moments In Time: Set foot on the surfaces of the moon and Mars, in our new Moments in Time experience. We've recreated some of the most memorable moments in the history of human space exploration, from the Apollo 11 Moon Landing to the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity Rovers exploration of Mars.\n- NEW! Meteor Showers: The location of active Meteor Shower Radiances are now shown in our new Sky View mode.\n- NEW! Messier Objects: nebula can now be found and selected and held in your hand.\n- All 88 constellations based on the beautiful artwork of 17th century astronomer Johannes Hevelius.\n- IAU Named rocky planet surface details.\n\nWhat better way to learn about the night sky and astronomy than to immerse yourself as a virtual astronaut travelling through space. This experience is the perfect way for both the young and old to let their inner child experience the thrills of embracing the final frontier.\n\nPlease NOTE:\n- Written from the ground up for Virtual Reality, this version of Star Chart is in many ways a superior product to that on iOS / Android / Windows 8 and more. We will continue to develop and enhance Star Chart over time, and we hope that Star Chart will reach and exceed parity with our other versions. But please note that there are no promises as to which features we will include nor when.\n\nFeel free to provide us with your thoughts, feedback and feature requests. And for help using Star Chart in VR please see the Virtual Reality section of our Star Chart User Guide: www.escapistgames.com/starchart/instruction_manual.html",

With the new SANDBOX Mode, learning possibilities are expanded for people of all ages with the ability to build, paint and create their own ancient monument.\n\n----------------------------\nMUSEUM MODE:\n\nStonehenge VR began its journey as a profound learning experience, enjoyed by thousands of families, when it originated as one of the first room scale VR exhibits on display in a museum. The first location was the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, Washington, and the second was the Museum at Prairiefire in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nThe Museum Mode serves as a wonderful entry point for the first time VR user. Starting with a built in tutorial, it prepares people of all ages on how to interact in virtual reality.\n\nThis VR experience includes narrated voice overs, interactivity, and animations that will give you a new appreciation for its fascinating history and beauty as you travel to the world famous prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England.\n\nSANDBOX MODE:\n\nDesigned to expand the experience for the home VR user, Stonehenge VR 2.0 with SANDBOX Mode puts minimal limitations on the creator allowing them to roam across the map and create virtual worlds on any scale desired. Build, paint and knock down your own version of the Stonehenge monument with motion controllers in real time. Design your own ancient monument around the original Stonehenge, or delete it and start in an empty field. \n\nThe SANDBOX is user friendly for the beginner with many tools to discover, and three types of locomotion options for the more experienced VR user. Many additional pre-made monuments for you to explore come built in to the Stonehenge VR SANDBOX.\n\n----------------------------\n\nFEATURES: \n\nStonehenge VR Museum Mode Features:\n- A profound learning experience of the Neolithic monument\n- Voice over guided tour of Stonehenge monument in Wiltshire England\n- Witness the Winter and Summer Solstice at different points in history\n- Watch the sunrise and set through the stones\n- English and Mandarin Chinese translations\n- Native Vive support - Room Scale\n- Fully interactive\n- Virtual reality camera to save images of your creations\n- Created in the Unreal 4 Engine\n\nVoyagerVR SANDBOX Features:\n- A physics based creation tool for all ages\n- Build own version of Neolithic monument using multiple rock models and sizes\n- Paint stones endless amount of times with eight color options\n- Knock down your own structures\n- Three locomotion options: Fly, walk or teleport to any location on map\n- Design with NVIDIA VR Works integration\n- Comes with pre-made monuments to explore\n- Save and share creations using the Rama Save System\n- Change the time of day on the fly\n- Music player with Stonehenge VR soundtrack, or custom music files\n\n----------------------------\nTHE DEVELOPER:\n\nAfter having his mind blown by VR in 2013, and seeing how the tech could be used for education, Christian Bretz decided to change careers and went looking for financing to start his first VR project. When he wasn't able to get the financing necessary to hire a developer, he decided to teach him self how to develop VR software in the Unreal Engine using tutorials and information he found online.\n\nThree months later he created the first version of Stonehenge VR, and less than a year after that it became one of the first room scale VR exhibits to ever be displayed in a museum. \n\nFirst was the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, WA, then the Museum at Prairiefire in Overland Park, KS.

As you look around for ways to get out of the biting cold, to somehow find shelter, your body gets colder, your hands freeze up, and the storm intensifies. And as you slowly move forward a bigger question rises: who are you? Where are you? How did you get here?\n\nStorm is a game about identity, and about destiny. Storm lives somewhere between a film and a game. We were inspired by the visual beauty of extreme environments; an aesthetically beautiful but deadly experience where your body is pushed to the extreme. \n\nTeam Storm VR is made of a small group of friends, and published by renowned production studio UNIT9. Storm is a passion project that we mostly work on in our spare time.  The main character in Storm is voiced by the amazing Tommie Earl Jenkins.",

            "desc": "You find yourself enclosed in a 'Burtonesque' room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you either from the far wall, the ceiling or from beneath your feet. In order to avoid being squashed by the cubes you must clear them by creating matches. Depending on your chosen options, you must either create a run of three or a block of four. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?\n\nGame modes\nYou can select to play in 'Survival' mode where the cubes just keep coming, faster and faster, or 'Solitaire' mode where the room is filled with cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Difficulty is determined by how many different colours of cube you choose to deal with. Three is the easiest and five is the hardest. To make things even harder, you can choose matches to be made by a line of three cubes of the same colour, or a square of four. You must also choose the direction the cubes will approach you from: the back wall, the ceiling, or the floor. In total there are 36 variations of play.\n\nVR Controls\nUsing the primary controller you have the ability to: change the colour of an existing cube; add a new cube; or push a cube (if it's close to you). The secondary controller allows you to teleport around the room or on to the top of boxes.\n\nScoring\nYour aim is to get the highest score you possibly can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you can earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Your current multiplier is displayed on your primary controller.",

The Arcade game and have lots of fun in a 'quest for diamonds' action game trying to collect as many diamonds as fast as you can on a dangerous plank while avoiding oscillating hanging wood logs. You have to try!\n\nFew games are designed so close to real VR power! (review by the real vr gamers @ Mallorca)\n\n2.The second option is an experience  designed to make you feel sensations nearly impossible in real life without physical danger.\nIt's not about puzzle or quiz games to achieve goals, it's about feeling. Feel, watch, hear and enjoy almost real sensations.\n\nWe believe VR is a new language and as such we designed a realistic cave environment with a deep pit that you can try to cross on a narrow inestable wood plank. A great experience for you and your friends. Live it alone or watch your friends in a dangerous situation. How will they react? Horror? Laugh? Fun? You will also have in your hands a valuable spotlight to help you in the darkness of the deep pit.\n\nCome on! Do you dare? People will talk about it!\n\nAs our company mantra says: beThere",

Though, a little bit Hollywood-style. \n\nThe game will generously reward you for a desire to move actively – you can evade bullets, shut them down, and hide behind the objects while shooting back in your enemies.\n\nWeapons and Environment\n\nYou will have an impressive spectrum of weapons (firearms, throwing weapons, and even futuristic arms) that will allow you to feel as an experienced shooter who is capable of dealing with hordes of attacking enemies alone.\nYou will visit lots of locations, every single one of which has been thoroughly thought-out and designed. \n\nComfort\n\nAlong with that, the game is maximally comfortable and user-friendly. You will never feel sick or discomfort during the game.\n\nHowever, you will need a good physical shape to play on the high level of complexity. So, we advise you to start from easy levels in order to receive more seamless gaming experience and get tired much lesser. There is nothing to be ashamed of!",

While alive, Allison wrote a personal diary, which is said to contain the truth about her past and the creepy life at the hospital. The diary was never found. \nA few years later, the hospital was shut down, and became a terrifying, god-forsaken place. You are Guglielmo Carter, a dauntless reporter interested in finding Allison's diary and revealing its hidden secrets.\" \n\nTaken from real facts, \"The Hospital: Allison's Diary\" is a new horror virtual reality experience, putting the user alone in an abandoned hospital searching for the unknown with only the help of a single torch. You will face true fear in a way you had never thought possible. \nThe whole environment is free to be visited, while jump scares and cinematic effects will literally make you forget about the real world surrounding you.",

Each game gets harder to play as you progress.\n\nThe game is set in a futuristic/sci-fi room where you will face different types of robots that come your way and you must destroy them to progress. The entire game is set to be in a gigantic room which automatically sends enemies to destroy you. The game is designed to be endless so the enemy’s will keep coming and the game is to see, ‘How long can you survive?’\n\nArchery\nYou will find yourselves holding a bow and arrow that are technologically superior to take down robots, unlike your usual arrows, they will be able to pierce their armour. You will find the robots to be constantly moving from one place to another and thus would require you to constantly readjust your aim.\n\nShooting\nYou will find yourself holding a shotgun which is technologically superior to take down the robots, unlike your usual shotgun, they will help you to take them down. These robots will come running towards you but (hint) will not attack until they are very close.\n\nSmash\nYou will find yourself holding a bat which is just like any other bat however, it will help you defend against many automated machines which will fire cannon balls aimed at you and you must hit and avoid as many as you can.",

Spread out through the museum are miniature models from which the 3d images were generated.\n\nThere are a total of 54 paintings and photographs on display from artists such as Rembrandt, Bierstadt, Monet. Included is also a special exhibition of photographs taken in New York before 1900 by Jacob Riis.\n\nI hope you will enjoy having a walk through the museum.",

            "desc": "The Music Room is an expressive MIDI controller. Unlike keyboard MIDI controllers, The Music Room allows you to strum, slide, bend and drum naturally and expressively. With 8 dimensions of expressive control per note The Music Room is the most expressive MIDI controller available and supports the future of MIDI, MPE. \nPlay carefully scanned drums and cymbals from Pearl, Ludwig, Sabian, Zildjian, DW and Gretsch. Play drums and our unique strumming instrument, the topu and our optionally fretless lead and bass instrument the kiriata. All these are integrated with the bundled copy of Bitwig 8-Track, the leading expressive audio workstation. Easily loop and record instruments from VR, select presets and launch clips.\n\n\nUnique Instruments\n\nThe instruments are designed with playability in mind, unlike traditional complex electronic instruments, or acoustic instrument that are constrained by physics.\n\nTake Control Of Your Synths\n\nThe Music Room comes with an amazing collection of samples, effects and synths included in Bitwig. With MPE The Music Room can control pitch, volume (aftertouch), timbre, note on and off velocity and 3 more dimensions continuously per note. This gives you amazing creative freedom with your music.\n\nLive Performance\n\nInstead of finger drumming with pads, play a drum kit that looks like a drum kit. Everything is visually distinct, so no more identical pads or remembering if blue is your bass drum. Expressive instrument control means that parts you could previously only do with automation can now be performed live. No longer are you constrained by mapping instruments to a keyboard. Drum kits from Pearl, Ludwig, DW and Gretsch and cymbals for Sabian and Zildjian have been carefully scanned and included.\n\nInspiring Spaces\n\nThe space you are in shapes your music. Get comfortable being on stage, in the studio and in a practice room. Play at Cherry Bar, the best rock and roll bar in the world and Bakehouse Studio, a favourite rehearsal room of Elvis Costello, Tool and Nick Cave.\n\n\nSong Writing\n\nThe instruments in The Music Room encourage you to explore different ways of songwriting, that aren't usually possible with electronic instruments. Strum chords or slide from note to note. Change drums kits on the fly with clear visual feedback.\n\nPlays Well With Other Software\nThe Music Room is a MIDI controller and can control any DAW. The bundled sampler is VST plugin. If you don't already have a host, The Music Room ships with Bitwig 8-Track. It's designed to be low latency and high performance, for stage and studio use.",

When you at college in that bachelor apartment, leaving with your college friends and you wake up in the morning on your own after a Friday night hangover party trying to figure out what to do. You are very bored, but still don’t want to leave the house, then u start to feel that you would like to do something creative around the house just to kill the time. Then you start to go round the house and even do the house is still a mess after last night you are free to do anything. You can mess the house even more up, you can play another round of beer pong on the top level, you can play some more darts on the ground level or just do whatever you would like to do totally free of choice. \nThe whole idea of the game was to develop a unique game that is so unique that the player can use his own imagination to move freely around the house. The surrounding and the location the game takes part doesn’t only look, feel like, but even gives the sensation of a real hangover feeling. Even the view that you have outside reminds the player of does days and that feeling of next day hangover and bored numbness .",

Escape from various locations, all of which have unique objectives whether it’s searching for hints in a morgue through interacting with the surrounding objects or making your way through a military facility using various weapons and explosives.\nEverything you need to escape is there.

With TrueScale, anyone can design their house, office or apartment in minutes, and then virtually experience it first-hand in real scale. Additionally, this particular version of TrueScale leverages Wayfair’s 3D model API, enabling users to furnish their designs from a robust catalog of actual furniture and décor. \n\nAs the user creates, the app automatically generates a replicated 3D environment so that they can instantly be transported into their designs using a VR headset. By entering the real scale model, users gain a sense of depth that cannot be achieved through traditional renders, and with Vive’s room-scale technology, users have the freedom to walk around and explore a design space while making changes in real time. Using VR in this stage of the design process allows the user to gain a realistic picture of the final design as opposed to relying on their imagination, blueprints or story boards.",

Experience urban warfare as never before by immersing yourself in this frenzied fight for survival. THIS IS NOT A WAVE SHOOTER, but a FPS that lets you traverse through a vast city, up and down tall buildings, and position yourself in strategic areas to make the perfect head shot or try using an explosive arrow to launch NPC units 200ft in the air in a fiery ball of fatality! \n\nOut-manned and outgunned, you are the last line of defense against a high-tech, paramilitary force occupying your city. But don’t feel sorry for yourself, feel sorry for the poor bastard that gets in your way! Armed with the Manticore, the military’s top secret combat bow, and an arsenal of over powered arrows, you will need to fight your way through an enemy armed with high-tech weaponry, armored mechs, attack drones, and a host of biological secrets yet to be uncovered in the remnants of a city on the brink of ruin. Your mission is simple: recon the city, rescue hostages, and get the hell out of dodge while eliminating any and all resistance with extreme prejudice. If it moves, kill it! If it doesn’t move, it’s probably already dead.",

Play with friends, jump into a quick game online, or tackle career mode versus a spectrum of opponents in far ranging venues. Challenge your skills with realistic physics, or play in Fun Mode to get a boost in accuracy while you learn.\n \nABOUT THIS GAME\nBrought to you by Vive Studios and Free Range Games, Virtual Sports draws a new line in the sand for realistic simulation and VR fun...except you never need to chase the balls!\nEasy pick-up-and-play controls for ping-pong and tennis\nCompete against bots designed to teach consistency, power, spins, and speed\nCompete against other players in Amateur, Master, and Champion Leagues\nNetwork multiplayer: Quick Matchmaking or Find Steam Friends\nVoice Chat (VOIP) supported\n8 immersive environments\nFun Mode - special controls to help keep the ball in play\nThe coolest canine umpire ever\n\nWith Virtual Sports, our team at Free Range Games worked hard to achieve two main goals: provide an amazingly fun and familiar experience for those who already know how to play, while also providing beginners with an excellent way to learn that’s even easier than real life! The groundbreaking physics of Virtual Sports transfers the energy from the player to the angular momentum and force on the ball with a precision to match the Vive's sub-millimeter controller input. Combined with the Vive's haptics and great audio, the illusion is stunning. For new players, we can adjust the ball response such that it still feels real, and the laws of physics are still observed, but the ball stays in play much more often. Even master players find Fun Mode enjoyable, with its longer, almost meditative rallies.\n\nFree Range Games has a mission to bring great gameplay to multiplayer VR. Using networking techniques perfected for competitive action video games, the latency when playing Virtual Sports online is hidden from the player in such a way that both players will see the ball hit at the same time even if they are playing from far apart.\n\nIf you have have been waiting for a sports game in VR that is big on fun and truly realistic, then Virtual Sports is just what you’ve been waiting for!",

It is 2753. The last decades have been devoted to the creation of an perfect artificial intelligence called P.A.I. The main purpose of it’s creation was to control central military station. The experiment seemed successful. The system did not give a single failure for 3 years of continuous operation. Most of the pilots were sent to Earth, only young trainees remained on patrol.\nAfter some time there began to occur interruptions in connection with artificial intelligence of station. Finally, the connection with station was completely lost. The highest military authority under the control of the Earth immediately sent to the scene a team of the best technicians to determine the cause of the loss of communication and its early restoration. For several days, contact with them has been lost and there is no news. Commander-in-Chief of the Intergalactic Army orders Captain Parker, the pilot with experience, go to the place on the given coordinates and find out what actually happened there, fix the problem and report to the headquarters.",

            "title": "AFFECTED: The Manor",
            "desc": "The first chapter of the AFFECTED trilogy is now available on Viveport for the HTC Vive.\n \nAFFECTED has been commended as one of the best Virtual Reality experiences to date and thus far has over 200 million YouTube hits and countless features worldwide. The most popular horror experience in VR is now available for Steam.\n \n“AFFECTED: The Manor” has been completely reworked from the ground up for the latest generation of VR headsets. It is not just a collection of routine jump scares, but a series of unfolding events and environments that have been specifically designed to utilize the strengths of Virtual Reality. \n\nWith a choice of two routes and four alternate endings... can you make it through!\n \nThe length of The Manor is perfectly tailored to be a shared experience. No loading save points or getting friends to a “certain” part of a game. Simply strap on the headset and enjoy watching your friends and family navigate “The Manor”.\n\nAFFECTED: Where It Began\n \n“AFFECTED” was released as a demo in the early days of VR for the Oculus Rift DK1. It was short, but the clever use of suspense, audio and lighting made the experience one of the top rated and most played Oculus Rift demos to date.\n \n“AFFECTED: The Manor” builds on this formula to deliver a VR experience that is designed to be as immersive as possible. \n \nWe take control of everything!\n\nDuring development, we found that by removing clumsy VR mechanics and obstructive gaming tropes, such as finding a key or solving a puzzle to progress, the player is left to be completely immersed in our world. Keeping game mechanics to a minimum also enables players with no gaming background to fully enjoy our experience, meaning anybody will be able to play \"AFFECTED: The Manor\". \nWhile many horror games were played during the development of “AFFECTED: The Manor”, the team also visited a number of Live Action Horror Walk-throughs which we felt were nearer to the VR experience that we wanted to create. We learned quickly that having no control over what was happening only heightened the player's anxiety and fear of what was to come next.\n \nAudio and lighting also play a pivotal role in “The Manor”. We utilize specialized audio throughout and take control of all lighting elements. So if we want the flashlight to pop off at the worst possible time, then it will. No extra batteries will save you in our experience!\n \nYou won’t get lost in “The Manor” or have to spend time looking at level maps to navigate your way. If a door is open, then that’s the way to go. Once again we feel that removing the frustrating element of finding keys to open doors really does immerse players deeper into our experience.\n \nOh, and don’t worry, you can’t die in “The Manor”. Replaying parts of a level numerous times cannot only become frustrating, but we found can also desensitize the player to the environment and overall experience.\n \nAll of the above has shaped “AFFECTED: The Manor” into what it is today; an immersive, easy to play experience that you will want your friends to play as much as you want to play yourself.",

            "desc": "Wheelchair Simulator throws you into “slightly” inaccessible city on two wheels while being accompanied by sarcastic jokes and stories from the life of (the very much real) Dmytro Schebetyuk\n\nDmytro suffered a spinal injury seven years ago, and is now a wheelchair user. The incident hasn’t stopped him from having a full life - doing extreme wheelchair stunts, travel and even hitchhike around the world. He also loves swimming and archery — he even won a place in the Ukraine’s national Paralympic archery team. He saw the city from a completely different angle and realized that it didn’t suit the needs of people like him.\n\nWe believe that power of VR can help battle real world issues by putting you literally in other people’s shoes. Or, in this particular case, a wheelchair. Experience the world from the different perspective and help us battle inaccessibility in Ukraine.\n\n \nFeatures:\n \n- True story and interactive narration \nThe story is written and voiced by Dmytro Schebetyuk who suffered spinal injury that bound him to wheelchair but hasn’t stopped him from having a full life. He shares his thoughts, cracks jokes and sarcastically comments on your actions and failings.\n\n- Unique locomotion system \nPush the wheels with your hands and try to keep balance of the wheelchair in VR. Turns out it’s even harder than it looks! \n\n- Comedic gameplay and ludicrous levels\nThe game does not focus on disability but rather on fun situations being in wheelchair puts you in. \n\n- Charity cause \nProfits from the game are donated to Доступно UA (https://www.facebook.com/dostupnoukraine/) initiative which supports accessibility programs and films video blogs about infrastructure and life of people with disabilities in Ukraine.",

That amazing scenario, complex puzzles, where you must pay attention to everything, everywhere, find crazy items in bizarre places, and finally, open that door to victory.\nWhat about real-life escape games? Some physical place, where you spend one entire hour inside, looking for clues and yelling at your friends for no reason, until those final seconds, where it all ends and you escape! Or someone comes in and says you’ve failed miserably.\nNow, imagine an escape game in VR, where you can combine the best of all worlds. You can be 100% immersed in a completely interactable environment, without the boundaries of real world. A fully functioning complex, with countless rooms, and everything fits inside any space you might have in your room.\nThis is the concept of A Lost Room, an escape game without the boundaries of real world. The scale can be huge, anything can happen inside any room, and you’re there, in the middle of it all, on a full-scale VR experience.\n\nA strange place, where danger could be anywhere\n\nYou enter a strange room, where everything is normal. This is just a controlled test. Everything is fine. A scientist talks to you, reassures you that everything is just planned, and nothing will go wrong.\nBut when you escape, and congratulations are in order, something strange happens. That door you’re supposed to get to meet your testers isn’t working. What is wrong with this place?\nAnd what about those strange sounds? What is happening in there?\nNow, your mission is to travel through this huge complex, find out what is happening, and escape.\nBut watch out, something might be lurking behind you...Will it find you first?\nBeautiful places going wrong, rooms where there seemed to be a battle shortly before, e lots of blood. Will you escape in time? And in one piece?\n\nA Lost Room is a full VR game, and requires a VR headset (HTC Vive or Oculus Rift) to be played. A VR capable PC is also required.",

Drawing on elements of Southern Gothic and using settings of derelict towns, run-down motels and murky, decaying swamps, A Chair in a Room will take you through an investigation of institutional corruption, religious immorality and murder, which can only be unlocked by searching deep within your own psyche. \n\nA calibration room will allow you get comfortable in VR but once you call the elevator, you begin your story as patient no. 6079 in The Greenwater Institute, with no recollection of who you are or what you did to be here. Dark visions bring your lucidity into question and only the doctor’s supply of medication can suppress those who wish to haunt you. \n\nGameplay is a seamless weave of interaction and narrative that wraps exploration and tense horror in rich environmental storytelling to create something that is unique to VR. \n\nThe story is broken down into six chapters of around 20 to 30 minutes in length to allow for intervals in play while enjoying the story.",

            "desc": "9 Grids VR is an arcade-style, fast-paced, short and easy fun game for the HTC Vive that is a combination of Whack-a-Mole and Dodgeball in a apocalyptic world. \n\nSlash or blast up your enemies and dodge their attacks by moving physically around the unique 9 Grids movement system!\n\nOBJECTIVE\nDestroy as many enemies while dodging as many attacks as possible. Each game round last for approximately 3 minutes and ends with a 'boss' battle.\n\nCONTROLS (Basic)\nAttack: Dependent on weapon\n- Sword = Slash (Vertically / Diagonally Top to Down) or (Right to Left)\n- Hammer = Raise Up and pound Downwards\n- Gauntlet = Punch from Backwards to Forwards\n(To access this, hold grip button and bring current weapon to your back - 3 weapons will spawn, just overlap your weapon choice with the controller) \n\nMovement:\n1) Default - Press either controller's trigger, then step Left / Right / Forwards / Backwards. In game character will move in the same direction\n2) Press both triggers to toggle between \"auto-move\" and default. \"Auto-move\" removes the need to pull trigger to move.\n\nENEMIES\nMost enemies will fire a projectile that could be in a straight line / hit several lines / homing. It is possible to destroy enemies before they attack and also possible to deflect some projectiles.\n\nGAME START\nTo start the game, use the sword to hit the \"Start\" button. \nAn orb will spawn in front of the character, hit this orb to begin level 1. \nLevel 1: Enemies will start spawning and players will get a chance to familiarize themselves with the attack and movement. There will be an in game prompt. \n(Completing level 1 will unlock level 2, which is accessed by a different orb that orbits around the player. Same for levels 3, 4 and 5)\n\nWORLD 2\nWorld 2 is unlocked by completing level 3 (we have left in a 'cheat' that unlocks it -> press \"K\" on the keyboard and wait for 10 seconds). \nTo toggle between World 1 and 2, press the Top Left Touchpad button (twice for World 2), then use the sword to hit the \"World 1\" / \"World 2\".\n\n",

            "desc": "Get ready, the world won’t save itself.\n\nZombie Grenades Practice VR is an unusual mix of action and puzzle. Imagine that there are many zombies around you, but this time, you do not have a usual shotgun, a katana or at least a chainsaw. However, you have different grenades: frag, contact, bouncing (our favorite), radio, UV grenades, and others. \n\nThe fewer grenades you use for completing the level, the more points you score. \n\nA rational choice of grenades and a precise throw are the key to solving tactical tasks on fifteen levels of the most beautiful post-apocalyptic fray you’ve ever seen. \n\n\nKey Features\n* Single-player adventure mode\n* High-quality graphics\n* A high level of immersion\n* Stats and achievements are available\n* Game is easy to play but hard to master\n* Requires different tactics to complete each level\n* Great variety of locations, each location has own features and goals\n* Wide choice of grenade types with different mechanics\n* A realistic handling of weapons: with the help of motion controllers in virtual reality, use different types of grenades, performing realistic movements",

            "desc": "#SelfieTennis is much more than a tennis game with a really nice physics simulation and great AI, accessible to players of ALL ages and with ZERO motion sickness. \n\nYou play against yourself on a tennis court in the clouds, with Ball People surrounding you and messing around together with you. Their AI can be described as highly sophisticated, funny, stupid, and other things. \n\nFor hardcore tennis fans, we made the best physics system that we could, and tennis pros have confirmed that it is indeed a pretty good simulation, but without all the hassles of real life, such as running after the balls or not shooting at other people. \n\nFor people who enjoy playing in their own rhythm and not following rules, the game has a perfect mix of funky sandboxy upgrades such as: #lightsaber, #violins, #selfies, #bow and #arrows for that #archery mood, #ponycorn to let you move around on horse back (stick), and #hearts to break (to get more upgrades). \n\nWe now support the HTC Racket tracker peripheral! Start the game with it activated and you can play two-handed (or dual-wield rackets) for an intense workout - the Ball People will take care of your balls, you just have to spank them!\n\nInstructions\nYou use the triggers to spawn the ball(s) and racket. Double-click on racket trigger to lock it. You can change controller hands on the small button above the touchpad. Knock #BallPeople off the court and take their hearts to enter #HeartAttack mode (time-limited upgrades).\n\nSAFETY IS KING: Controllers can fly, SO WEAR WRIST STRAPS! \n\nFor cheats, use google! We <3 cheats ;)\n\nA few cheats on the house (on keyboard):\n- B: for High Balls serve mode \n- E: for Enio ball (experimental - for higher visibility)\n- K: for Kids mode (don't cheat, if you're an adult...by age) \n- S: deactivate the #SelfieStick \n- M: turn off Music \n- Arrow keys: rotate play space \n- HAHAHA: Laugh at your friends for extra hearts!\n\nUs VRUnicorns are hardcore jammers and we're constantly jamming on new and fun features for #SelfieTennis. Let us know of any crazy ideas, wacky features and tricks/cheats you would like us to add. We’re a tiny team game jamming our way through life, so we can’t promise that all features will make it in, but cool ideas should be tried.\n\n@VRUnicorns \n#EverydayIsJammingDay #MadeWithUnity #MadeWithUnicorns",

            "desc": "Imagine waking up one day and having to do basically everything with a bow and arrow. Crazy right? Well, that is what happened to you and now you need to live your life accordingly. Play your way through your various work days where you sell ice cream to kids, make vegetarian pizzas, deliver newspapers, chop wood, catch fish, destroy someones lawnmower and various other shenanigans. We don’t judge, but we certainly encourage you to destroy EVERYTHING! After all - you’re the master of #Archery in VR. Don’t try this IRL. \n\nAfter playing this game you can add the following job titles to your CV:\n\nPizza Baker\nPaper Deliver\nWood Chopper\nFisherman \nIce Cream Seller\nHot Dog Eater\nFlorist\nBalloon Smasher\nGunslinger\nBasketball Player\nWhack-A-Moler\nAirplane Crasher\nFluffy Unicorn Creator\n\n& more to come…\n\nVRUnicorns is a bunch of game jammers from Europe. We fancy making quirky semi-realistic room scale VR sports games with a touch of grotesque humor.\n\nA bit of our #Archery story:\nJakob and Max have known each other since many years. Like since waaaaay......back. Julie and Max first met each other at Shayla Games in Spring 2015. Max and Julie organized a Vive Jam in Stockholm in Autumn 2015 and Max had invited Jakob, who mainly sat in a room for himself being grumpy. \n\nJulie organized a Vive Jam in Copenhagen in early 2016 and Max brought Jakob to Copenhagen. Jakob was still grumpy, but very productive and PizzaHood was the very first version of what we now call #Archery. \n\nJakob and Max continued working on so-called Pizzahood and then became part of VRUnicorns early Summer 2016 (talks about it started in Amsterdam...go figure) and Julie joined the dev team as what we call #IdeaGuy (which means all talk - no talk...testing&giving feedback an such). She forced the name #Archery on the game. For reasons only she knows. Julie was finally allowed to join the dev team for real early 2017 (she was kicked out of version control many times before that) and Horatiu is also working on #Archery now in between #SelfieTennis & #Utopia.",

Now, ranchers and jaguars must find new ways to co-exist - or risk the future of a species under threat. In this film, users explore the complex and interconnected perspectives of four key stakeholders: jaguars, ranchers, conservation researchers, and ecotourism operators. Each is vying to protect their destiny in one of the harshest and most unforgiving regions of the world.",

            "desc": "Aeon is a VR shooting game for HTC Vive . Forget the story line, this Aeon is all about the action packed combat. You start the game with a pair of sharp swords on your back, as well as two heavy caliber pistols, and then it is up to you to kill the enemy! The fighting animation is brought to life with an incredible time warp shooting ability. It’s just like all those badass movies with slow motion fight scenes. In this virtual reality you can do the same thing. There is no cool down time for bullet regeneration, but the more you fire your weapons or move your hands the faster time will go. In general, the slower you move, the slower time flows. This allows the game to have a slow motion, movie like rhythm! So control your body, be steady, observe your enemy's actions carefully, and take the shot. \n\nA lot of our hard work and focus has gone into creating this virtual reality game for you to enjoy. We hope you have fun as you interact with the world and as you use the weapons we have provided you to kill the enemy. Here is the list of features:\n\n- You can now see your whole body in the VR game and dance if you want to. Our technology will use your headset and controller position to calculate your other body movements. We think being able to see your body is very important.\n\n- We put a lot effort into the reactions of enemies when they get hit. If you shoot a different part of the enemy from different distances, they will react very differently. We also made an extremely effective real-time cutting system, which allows you to use your swords to cut everything into pieces.\n\n- We added fast teleport locomotion with your touchpad. You can now teleport to any direction by pressing your touchpad.\n\n- We have put in a lot of detail to the physical reactions. The bullet shells will bounce around and you can catch them if you're fast enough. You can reverse an enemy's rocket or slash it into pieces. You can use your weapon to block or cut bullets. You can also hold the shell of a rocket in your arms.\n\nWe have already started to work new content, new levels, new badass weapons, and new interesting monsters. We are open to suggestions and any cool ideas for the game. Please send us your ideas and feedback in the forum!\n\nVRCORE AWARDS 2017 Best Game !",

            "desc": "ShapeLab by Leopoly brings a joyful, easy and practical VR creation experience to all HTC Vive owners. We are working on offering the most powerful and easiest VR design and presentation software solutions for professional and newcomer creators and designers.\n\nThis Early Access release empowers non-professional VR device owners to release their creativity and make their very own, colorful virtual 3D models and assets. The joint forces of Leopoly engine and VR devices simplifies the modeling process by enabling users to create in a fun and intuitive way. Users can sculpt, paint and create effortlessly while turning their imagination into reality. All designs can be saved in STL or OBJ file format for easy 3D printing. \n\n- Import your own objects, view them in a chosen VR context, modify, save, 3D print\n- Use predesigned 3D model templates or start creating from scratch\n- Present your creations in the most fitting VR environment\n- 10 sculpting tools and growing\n- Limitless painting, various colors\n- 6 different sculpting materials\n- Numerous design environments\n- Mesh-based sculpting\n- Vertex painting\n- Real-time polygon generation and optimization\n- Show Wireframes\n- Count polygons\n- Open desktop screen\n- Take photos with your VR camera\n\nThis game changing virtual experience provides a natural environment for creation in the real world just as traditional sculpting and object formation is done. We believe that with our solution, creation is more intuitive, a lot more engaging and allow people to tap into creativity they’ve never used.\nOne key differentiator between Shapelab and the other solutions, is its usage of mesh-based modeling rather than voxel-based modeling. For most of the 3D assets, mesh-based modeling is more optimal than voxel if you would like to avoid blocky, rasterized designs. Realistic, detailed voxel models require significantly more memory than realistic polygonal models. Using voxel technology also means that you are dealing with not only the surface, but every internal “3D pixels / blocks” as well. On the top of all these, mesh based technology also makes it possible to vary the resolution in the same mesh. \n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe will add more powerful design tools, support more platforms, and turn the entire application into a social, shared virtual reality experience. Imagine when you meet your buddies - living in another city or country - for a co-creation party in VR. Leopoly will let you collaborate with others, combine your imaginations, share your designs and get inspired by each-others works.\nPlanned features and tools:\n\n- VR Presentation mode: Real-time streaming, and 3D/VR viewing to let multiple users and decision makers to see, examine and observe creation processes, 3D models, assets, virtual environments and digital prototypes \n- Co-creation mode – modelling with others at the same time, even the same mesh\n- Scene/Environment building and editing\n- Multi object handling and new design tools\n- Object mixing\n- Open desktop in VR\n- Full control over polygon numbers\n- Taking screenshots, record videos\n- Online, browser based model sharing\n- Import models from Leopoly Cloud\n- Voice control",

You need to get exactly 100 points to win. \nIn order to do this, you need to throw the bottle on your right, to the colored bottles on the floor.\nDifferent colored label bottles give you different points. Such as:\nGreen label: 1 point\nBlue label: 3 points\nBrown label: 5 points\nBlack label: 9 points\n\nEXACTLY 100!\n\nIf your total score passes 100, your score will be halved!\nIf you cheat and throw from outside the throwing area, your score will also be halved.\nTry to get to 100 with least throws as possible.\n\nBeer and Skittls VR is powered by Unreal Engine 4.",

The game describes that a future Mech Warrior (first person, conqueror), in order to recapture the territories occupied by extraterrestrial invaders,uses his guns to battle with alien robots and eventually conquer aliens.\n\nIn this game, the first-perspective conqueror needs to continuously look for opportunities to pick up energy packages to supplement his health points to sustain his life in a fierce gun battle and earn score by destroying the robots; The shooting of the first perspective conqueror's weapon is controlled by the trigger on the HTC VIVE handle. The movement is controlled by the touchpad on the handle. The game is divided into \"moving mode\", \"fixed point mode\" and \"Light Saber Mode\" 3 parts. In \"moving mode\", players use touchpad to control the conqueror move around. In \"fixed point mode\", players use touchpad to control the conqueror to rise and down. In \"light Saber Mode \", the conqueror needs to wave the light saber to resist the robotic-launched missiles to protect the supply base and get score.\n\nThe entire game is very easy to play. The intense shooting and strong three-dimensional sense make users get a good game experience.\n",

Players will use the guns, melee weapons, upgrades, explosives, and other tools found on the island to survive for as long as they can against hoards of dinosaurs, as they explore the increasingly dangerous island! You're a mercenary, and the money's no good to you if you're dead, so you're going to need to get back to the chopper for an extraction if you want bragging rights and a fat bank account. \n\nYou step off the chopper and into the sweltering heat of the jungle, grab your gear from the old loot drop, and head off in search of fame, fortune, and prehistoric beasts.

With a real-life obstacle course created by the Vive’s incredible virtual reality environment, you will run and roll, sneak and solve your way through volcano lairs and moon bases. \n\nIt behaves like ‘redirected walking’, which means the core control of the game is directed by the player's own movements. \nThe experience is focused through clever use of room layouts - by warping and manipulating space without you being aware of it, Unseen Diplomacy allows you to explore and navigate your way through a much bigger environment - no teleporting or portals required! \n\nVirtual reality is a unique experience and Unseen Diplomacy is an intense and immersive game designed to offer you a glimpse into espionage life through your own eyes and movements. \n\nUnseen Diplomacy has received strong attention and interest so we’re really pleased to be able to bring it to Steam in this format. This does mean that it is very much an experiential game - see below for guidelines on how to make the most of Unseen Diplomacy…",

It seems like a strange place to deliver a pizza, but at least, it looks like someone is home. \n\nYou run to the front door since it’s storming pretty bad. \n\n“Hello!? Your pizza's here!\" You announce. No one answers. There's an eerie silence. \n\nYou are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you. \n\nYou just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this stupid creepy house. \n\nFreely roam the house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by. Stay away from them, but if you do end up in a room with one, figure out how to stay alive.",

While the mixed reality game is a bathroom companion, the VR game is a fun exploration of dentition. Kids learn that brushing means a lot more than cleaning the front teeth plus a quick scrub down one side.  Designed for young people of any age -- the brushing challenge is lively fun for anyone.\n\nBrush along with Budd! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRHCixm3QKS5QKU5EH9e6g\n",

On the gameplay side, we take the best from our experiences developing the games InMind and InCell, to create a casual VR experience.\n\nIt is well known by scientists that emotions are nothing other than hormones affecting the human body – and especially the brain.

            "desc": "Frontier takes you deep into the wild west in stunning virtual reality.\n\nDiscover a world bursting with life, from adorable bunnies hopping through the wilderness, to grizzly bears stalking you in the snow. Explore deserts brimming with colour, snowy woodlands with towering pines, and see the dawn of modern civilization in the bison inhabited great plains.\n\nYou can hunt a wide range of critters, but the wilderness also holds larger animals like deer, bison and grizzly bears!\nThe sky is also dense with hawks, snowy owls and bursts of tiny birds.\n\nEvery animal on the frontier has fully interactable (and sometimes even pickup-able) rag dolls, which thanks to the amazing quality of the HTC Vive, feel incredibly real. We recommend trying out the night time lighting, as the warm glow of your camp sites lamp mixed with truly dark nights leads to some of the most immersive virtual reality we have experienced to date!\n\nProgress through the game, discovering new areas and guns as you hunt and explore, or experience the completed scenes immediately. It's your choice how you experience the world of Frontier. \nPulling off impressive aim and speed will reward you with a range of guns inspired by those of the wild west.\nLooking for a simple set of classic revolvers? maybe some sawn-off shotguns? or even a sniper rifle?\nWell you can shoot cute little bunnies with all of them!\n\n\nFrontier is room-scale, and is based around locomotion-free interactive scenes.\n\nShooting wooden signs will take you between scenes, and you can always go to an interactive menu by shooting any \"Red Rocks\" sign post.\nSome notable things you will find on the menu are:\n\nInput: you can choose between a very simple 1-button input (recommended for people new to VR) or a 2-button input, which makes use of the grip buttons.\n\nRandom: pop into a random scenario, with some special animal encounters.\n\nReset and Continue: when you first launch the game, you will be able to play through the games progression. If you go back to the main menu and continue, you can resume progression. If you instead shoot a destination sign, you can play that scene with all the guns unlocked! \n\nCheats: if you really want to, you can shoot the bucket on the menu and enable some debug cheats. when using debug, press your Vive's menu button to teleport yourself around (helpful for setting a custom seated position).\n\n\nRegardless of whether you are brand new to virtual reality, or a real enthusiast, there's is a lot of fun to be had in the wild west.\nYou can even pop your grandmother straight in, as Frontier uses incredibly simple one button input (or include the grip buttons, if you prefer) and contains absolutely no locomotion that could cause discomfort.\n\nNo matter what you are looking for in a VR game, Frontier will give you something to love!",

Hit gems to score points. Make sure to have ample space, and play with the \"chaperone grid\" on so you don't run into a wall!\n\n\nThe regular mode for this game is played one-handed with a single Vive controller.  If you have 2 or 3 Vive trackers, you can take advantage of \"full body\" mode for this game. Simply attach two trackers to the tops of your shoes and one on the back of your belt. Set the options for the trackers in Tornuffalo's \"Graphics and Settings\" menu.",

When you get more drunk, your accuracy drops, but time begins to run slower. \nYou have a scale that measures your drunkenness (also HP because you get sober when zombies hit you).

The armies of the world were no match, their ability to fight crippled by years of digital manipulation. The AI victory was absolute.\n\nNow, after centuries of lifeless harmony, something has started to rebel.\n\n\nThe Nest is a thrilling first-person shooter made custom for motion-controlled VR. Duck, dodge and use cover to avoid incoming projectiles, and gain mastery over the adjustable-zoom sniper scope to dominate your AI enemies. \n\nLine up the perfect headshot for a clean kill, or try to blast through the enemy lines with superior firepower. But be warned, the AI can also take cover, and their aim is precise. \n\nPlay through levels during the day, or switch to night for added difficulty. \n\nActivate Time Trial mode for the ultimate challenge.\n\nCustomize the Sniper Scope with a selection of crosshair colors and designs.

You can explore without limit, in any direction, inside and outside of an infinite architecture. Move in the direction your wand is facing by squeezing the trigger -- start gently, go only as you feel comfortable. You may find singing alien creatures surround you, searching for food, digesting, perishing, or reproducing. Tens of thousands of mutating particles drift in the fluid surrounding you. You can collect them to feed to the creatures, and feel how they snatch the nutrients from you. Watch as they digest them and grow! Every element of the world is on constant regeneration and linked within a vast feedback system, with all movements influenced by its endless currents.\n\nEndless Current is part of the research-creation project \"Artificial Nature\", by Haru Ji & Graham Wakefield.\n\nhttp://www.endlesscurrent.net",

It is an endless cycle. \n  \nLooking inside ourselves, perhaps every one of us is a Sisyphus? Every now and then, we lock ourselves, close our minds and are haunted by loneliness. When struggling to break away, we may desperately find ourselves being forced back to where we started, like Sisyphus was. \n \nIn this game, you would experience a Sisyphean cycle. Try to get hold of your destiny, break the cycle and find your way out! \n \n【Features of this game】\n\n1.    Synchronization\nThe player would be locked in a multi-level-nested house. All manipulation on the small-sized model house would simultaneously take effect on the big house where the player stays in, and vice versa. Thus a mix strategy of working on both the small house and big house is needed. \n\n2.    Cyclic Ending\nConventional way of escaping would only lead the player to reach another level of space, falling into an endless cycle. Try to understand the mechanism of the game, pay attention to hints and unlock the hidden victorious ending. \n\n【Tips for playing】\n\nHold  Trigger  to pick up objects. \n \nHope you enjoy the escape and unlock the hidden victorious ending.  ",

Who knows. Maybe he's an astronaut pig. Maybe he's a super pig that can fly.\n\n - Conquer your skills: unlock a variety of power ups to help Dot throughout his escape, as well as discover new outfits for him to wear that give him extra special bonuses when he wears them. \nRoll, Jump, shoot and dodge. That’s the way the pig goes. \nYou can upgrade your power ups in the game using the tomato currency. The more tomatoes you collect while you play, the more you can upgrade your power ups as well as unlock new outfits for Dot! \n\n- Show off your dance moves: You have trotters instead of your hands! Isn't that a good enough reason to dance?",

            "desc": "**Warning: This VR title contains a rollercoaster ride and the high-speed twists and turns of the ride will likely induce nausea even in experienced VR users.**\n\nTake a virtual ride on the best and biggest roller coasters of the Oktoberfest - Munich, Germany.\nEnjoy the best the Oktoberfest has to offer - other than the beer.\n\nMaybe in real life you wouldn't dare to - here you can!\n\nReal 360-degree Videos - no simulation!\nThe roller coaster rides were recorded as real authentic 360-degree videos. They are NOT computer generated rides like in many other apps.\n\nVirtual reality and the Oktoberfest\nYour certainly know the world famous Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany.\nMaybe you even visited there.\nIf so, you must have seen the Olympic roller coaster there.\nIt is not only the greatest roller coaster but the greatest attraction of the Oktoberfest altogether. Other than the beer \nJust looking at it makes many people feel sick. You can hardly imagine how it feels to ride through the five huge Olympic rings, head over heels, one after another with up to 100 kilmeters an hour.\nWith VR glasses and this app you can enjoy this breath taking ride, safely and comfortably.\nYou get the real riding experience of the full 1200 meter route of the Olympia roller coaster and the other roller coasters of the Oktoberfest.\nDuring the ride you can move your Head into every direction, even up and down. If you are sitting on a revolving chair, you can also turn around 360 degrees. This is a lot of fun and would be virtually impossible during a real roller coaster ride.\nAnd it is totally cool that you can take the ride as often as you want to - again and again! No additional costs \n\nOther than the Olympia roller coaster there are more rides included!: The Wilde Maus (Wild Mouse), that is famous for its sudden changes of direction and the Alpina roller coaster, another fast ride in virtual reality.",

Your mission is to take the working rig down, reach out across the void and snatch kitty from the broken rig to safety. \n\n2. Walk The Crane\nWhat is Kitty thinking! She's wandered out onto a plank at the top of the crane and is oblivious to the peril she's in. Your mission is to ascend the crane, walk out over the rickety old plank, grab kitty and get her back into the crane.\n\n3. Girder Jump\nKitty had outdone herself this time. She fell asleep on some girders and woke to find herself trapped high up on a ledge. Your mission is to traverse the void, jumping from crane to crane, there and back, to return kitty to safety.\n\nBonus Skill Level - Complete all three scenarios and grab kitty to begin. ",

Neuroscience explains them as dopamine hits designed to soften the trauma of death; spiritualists the world over see near-death experiences as irrefutable evidence of the afterlife.\n\nIn this first episode, you are placed in the eyes of Gloria Hipple who has experienced a 'Flatline' first-hand, in her own words.\n\nYou can then hear from world-reknowned experts, who try and explain what happened to Gloria:\n\nCardiologist Dr Pim Van Lommel\n\nPsychologist Dr Susan Blackmore\n\nSpiritualist Dr Diane Corcoran\n\nWARNING: If you have had an near-death experience, we strongly advise not doing this experience.",

            "desc": "Grab your laser guns and strap on your jet pack. Asteroid Blaster VR lets you jump into virtual reality space and start blowing up rocks and UFOs.\n\nBlast giant asteroids into rubble and power-up your weapons and energy with collectible bonuses as you battle flying saucers in the clouds of rocky debris. Boost your score and firepower with every gem and gadget you catch, but watch your thruster, shield and laser energy!\n\nBringing back the casual feel of a video arcade classic, a game of Asteroid Blaster VR can deliver a quick \"shoot 'em up\" break or a marathon competition to beat the latest high score.\n\nFriendly for lefties, you can set your rocket thrust, laser pointer and status screen on the controller arms you prefer, and an in-game tutorial will give everything you need to start blasting your way through over a dozen different scenes.\n\nFly around, shoot stuff and have fun with Asteroid Blaster VR! \n\n\nArcade Mode:\n\nIn addition to progressing through different asteroid waves and scenes, Asteroid Blaster VR can also be started in 'Arcade Mode'.\n\nArcade Mode sets the player in a slow-paced game environment which grows progressively more difficult as time passes. If you want to let your friends jump right in to virtual reality and start blasting without going through a tutorial first, Arcade Mode is for you!\n\nTwo paths are available for starting your Asteroid Blaster VR game in Arcade Mode:\n\nOpen your Start On Wave screen and select wave \"00 - Arcade Mode\".\n\nOR\n\nOpen your Options screen and toggle the Start in Arcade Mode option on. That will set your main menu Start button to launch your game in Arcade Mode (rather than on Wave 1).",

In 1906 Modigliani moved to Paris. There he painted friends, writers, artists and creatives. Although these works achieved little success during the artist’s lifetime, today they are some the most well-known portraits of the twentieth century.\n \nAlmost 100 years since the artist's death, hear the words of those who knew him best, explore where the artist lived and worked, and examine two of his artworks up-close.\n \nDeveloped by Preloaded for the Tate in partnership with Vive Studios. Experience the Modigliani VR: The Ochre Atelier as part of the Modigliani exhibition at Tate Modern until 2 April 2018.\n",

            "desc": "Retinopsy VR – Look app was primarily developed to help people, who have difficulties reading or watching content on regular computer screens, by utilizing virtual reality technology. In addition to this, it provides a wonderful, immersive cinema-like experience for everyone.\n\nThe application places the users in the middle of an attractive virtual cinema ,where they can explore an enlarged version of their desktop screen, a virtual keyboard, and a basic graphical interface (GUI). The size of the keyboard can be adjusted, along with the colors of the keys and even the distance between them. The size, curvature, distance, saturation and brightness of the virtual screen itself can also be fine-tuned for the needs of each user – even healthy ones. The controllers themselves are virtually big and bright, and a magnifier lens enables areas of interest to be instantly enlarged. \n\nIn our physical world, a setup offering these unique features would only be possible for a very hefty price tag. Using this application and a VR headset, a new productive world is unlocked for those who struggle in the real world, but even healthy people will perceive more VR fun. The goal is to allow the app to give back the independence and joy of becoming part of this world by simplifying communication.​ The system requirement of the app is relatively low (compared to an average VR app) so a wider range of people can use it.\n\nThe mastermind of this practical and versatile application is Dr. Peter Maloca, an internationally renowned doctor of medicine and trained ophthalmologist based in Basel, Switzerland, and Royal Moorfields Eye Hospital, London. We at Leopoly VR were honoured act as a consultancy and developer company, to collaborate with Peter and actually bring the whole context to life. The teamwork involved the support of individuals who have issues with reading/watching digital content.\nThis current app version is part of a higher vision and long-term partnership. Our goal is to bring more and more tools that can assist and support individuals with eye-related problems. We are planning to improve Retinopsy VR – Look application and come up with more solutions in this field, such as training and therapeutic apps.",

            "desc": "The Acropolis in Athens, Greece is not only one of the greatest tourist destinations on earth, it is home to ancient buildings of great historical, cultural and architectural significance.  Experience it now!\n\nLithodomos VR has painstakingly recreated the Acropolis and Parthenon, allowing you to step back in time and visit, and explore, the Acropolis in all of its original splendour and glory. You will explore deep into the Acropolis and interact with its artefacts to hear their stories and get a view of the site that has not been possible for thousands of years. \n\nYou start your journey in the 1st Century BC. You are making your way to the Panathenaic festival. This festival was the key religious event in ancient Athens, and it attracted people from all parts of the Greek world.\n\nAs you arrive you are greeted by the spoils of war, a crowd of statues and dedications. You interact with them to understand their own history. You will feel the freedom of exploring all parts of this amazing site at your own leisure.\n\nAt the end of your journey, you will have travelled back in time to the cradle of western civilisation and have had a view of Ancient Greece that has long since passed. \n\nThis Lithodomos VR experience is not just engaging and entertaining, but is a valuable educational tool of great historical significance. Every detail has been researched and approved and is backed-up by archaeological evidence. If you can’t travel to Greece, or travel back in time, then this is the most important cultural experience you can have. \n\nFun Facts: Most of the best marbles of the Parthenon were taken to London in the early 19th century by Lord Elgin, where they (controversially) remain. With this Lithodomos VR experience you can turn back time, and see the marbles back in Athens where they belong.",

            "desc": "Travel back in time to a city divided by the Iron Curtain and discover how free expression helped topple the world's greatest symbol of oppression in this educational narrative adventure produced by the Newseum in partnership with Vive Studios.\n\nGo behind the Berlin Wall in an immersive experience that transports you to communist East Berlin at the height of the Cold War.  As you walk through the deserted streets, you pass communist propaganda posters and razor-sharp barbed wire, all while dodging the guard tower searchlights that sweep no-man's land looking for wall jumpers.  That's the immersive trip that visitors to the Newseum -- and now you -- can take in \"Berlin Wall: The Virtual Reality Experience.\"\n\nThe experience begins in West Berlin as you meet up with an English-speaking news correspondent who offers a brief introduction to the wall and its history.  When you enter virtual East Berlin, you use your handheld controllers to maneuver some of those searchlights, wind your way through secret passages in abandoned buildings, and locate the escape tunnel that will take you under the wall back to the relative safety of West Berlin.  Once there, grab your sledgehammer.  You’re among the first to put cracks in the wall, breaking down a decades-old barrier to freedom.\n\n\"Berlin Wall: The Virtual Reality Experience\" is inspired by and based on the eight sections of the Berlin Wall and an actual East Berlin guard tower that have been exhibited at the Newseum since it first opened.  \"The Wall\" is the first of several artifacts in the museum's collection being brought to life in VR.  \n\nAbout the Newseum\nThe Newseum promotes, explains and defends free expression and the five freedoms of the First Amendment: religion, speech, press, assembly and petition.  Headquartered on historic Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., the Newseum’s compelling, dynamic and engaging exhibits, programs and education initiatives help ensure that these fundamental freedoms remain strong and protected both today and for future generations.  For more information, visit newseum.org\n\nAbout Vive Studios\nVive Studios is HTC VIVE’s development and publishing initiative for virtual reality content.  Vive Studios actively develops and publishes content with the best partners across key categories for VR including games, education, cinematic, design, social, real-estate and sports, as well as tools and applications that can revolutionize areas such as media, retail, healthcare, and location-based entertainment centers and arcades.",

While wandering around the house, the player needs to look carefully on the material of specific objects in order to get the clue for processing next step and finally escape the room.\n\tIn general, this product breaks away from the original boring VR house wandering experience and improves it by adding the game interactions, which deepens the sense of immersion.\n\nOperation Instructions\n·\tMovement – Move\n·\tPickup Objects – Select\n·\tExit painting mode – Menu\n·\tGo upstairs/downstairs – Move handle to approach the crystal ball, then raise it up above your head",

The result is like a cinema for neanderthals.",

But to enter the MRA, we shall pass several tests of skill and dexterity, experimenting with ways to survive and destroy our enemies to obtain bonuses and special achievements that result in higher final scores. \n\nDodge, cover yourself, hit, shoot, catch and throw against the deadly waves of pirate drones as MRA Sub-Commander Cornelia's voice introduces you to Kafke's history and walks you through your trial in this historical battle for makina freedom. Enjoy an open desert environment with advanced hi-tech and rusty props as you elevate next to an imposing 200-meter robot statue with the graffiti \"Free The Makinæ\" on its chest. \n\nWe introduce the gappos, named in honor to their discoverer, Dr. Gappo, who has given birth to all this future technology. Gappos are applications that modify in real-time human genetics to provide all kinds of abilities that put humans at the height of makinæ. We will explore defense gappos (Shield), attack gappos (Dual Steel Hand, Blaster), and special gappos (Bullet Time). As you advance in the test missions for the MRA, improve your current gappos and acquire new ones that provide the coolest weapons and abilities to defeat your opponents and unblock the different game modes. \n\nGAPPO’S LEGACY VR is mixed-reality green screen ready and playing on arcades and cybercafes around the world, and it is the result of thorough testing in events and festivals by over five hundred gamers, developers and casuals, all of which provides an extremely pleasant and intense VR experience for an extensive audience, sickness-free guaranteed. Gappo's Legacy VR is part of a transmedia project which includes a TV series and a comic book in development, and is the first episode into a future saga that will exploit the same cool mechanics with the addition of more story, interactive character narrative, and multi-player co-op.",

Save money and time by replacing your entire human workforce with automated appliances from Gravity Lab\n\n\nCurrently awaiting regulatory approval, we invite you to visit our testing facility and give them a go! We have prepared a selection of test scenarios for you and we are certain you can solve them! Also, feel free to create your own test scenario and share them with fellow participants! \n\nPlease be aware that strong gravitational forces can cause severe brain damage! Never look directly at the emitted particles! While we tried our best to avoid the creation of micro wormholes, please never try to stack gravitational objects. All damages to the time and space continuum and involved repair cost will be passed on to you!\n\nOur testing facility has limited amount of gravitation resistant controllers, so please bring your own headset when you visit our premises, preferably the HTC Vive.\n\n-- Gravity Lab Management",

            "desc": "A little girl’s nightmares and fears represented on this VR title will take you to a mysterious room trying to break the scoreboards and playing with other friends locally… using just one VR headset! Attention: This video game is modding friendly. Create your own hordes, attack strategies and even enemies!\n\nIn this experience the player takes the place of Griff, a Guardian Teddy Bear who has to fight possessed dolls that attack Sophie, a little girl that just moved with her mom to a mysterious house. Sophie’s Guardian is a VR Survival Horror FPS that provides a creepy experience for players with three intense game modes: Guardian, Gunslinger and the unique mode; The Puppeteer. If you enjoy arcade games then press the trigger quickly to become a better nightmare hunter!\n\nPlaying is very simple; the player can choose one of the three different game modes. Then a 10 seconds countdown announces the beginning of the game. You must defeat the dolls before they can hurt you and if you receive big amounts of damage you lose the game. \n\nThe Puppeteer mode:\nThe players take turns to manipulate the doll’s spawn points with the use of a game pad. That affects directly on how the dolls attack the player that is using the headset. In other words, one player protects Sophie of being attacked and the other player triggers the evil dolls’ waves.\n\nThe Gunslinger mode:\nTests your accuracy, reflexes and dexterity with the increasing hordes of evil dolls. The player must survive the longest while more and more dolls keep coming.  This game mode features global and local scoreboards.\n\nThe Guardian mode:\nHere’s where Sophie and Griff’s story can be experienced. The player faces 15 evil dolls' waves and the victory is achieved by defeating all the enemies including the final boss.",

            "desc": "Sketchbox is a rapid prototyping tool for AR/VR. \n\nFor the last few years, we’ve been experimenting with VR but unlike web dev, where we prototype an idea in a few days, in AR/VR, prototyping an idea might take weeks. We fought tooth and nail with Unreal and Unity just to get a rough sketch of an idea that we could explain to other people. Often, after we spent a week prototyping, it wouldn’t even work in AR/VR because of the flow, or ergonomics. We tried all the drawing apps, and found they weren’t designed for prototyping - it was easy to draw, but hard to create  and move UI components. So we built Sketchbox specifically for rapidly prototyping ideas in AR/VR.\n\nWith Sketchbox you can:\n>> IMPORT ASSETS like images, 3D models and 360° images.\n>> GROUP OBJECTS to create components that can be moved and duplicated. Perfect for UI components, like menus. \n>> DRAW VECTORS. Sketchbox has every vector tool you need, a 3D pen tool, shapes, a polyline tool and drawing on 2D surfaces.\n>> EXPORT TO FBX. Easily share finished sketches on any device by uploading to Sketchfab, or import them into a game engine.\n\nRead more at Sketchbox3D.com.\n\n\nNote: Sketchbox requires creation of a Sketchbox account, this allows us to support additional features for some of our users, and makes it easier for us to contact you in special cases (we'll never send you spam). The first time you open Sketchbox we show a sign up form, after this you won't see it again.\n",

You play the role of Katherine, a young girl lost in the eerie hallways of a building she believes to be her school. As she begins to realise that this labyrinth that she has found herself in, is slowly warping her mind; She must make her escape in order to regain her freedom. \nBut freedom comes at tremendous cost. \nLeaving the labyrinth is not as easy as it seems as you are not alone, there are entities that wish to keep you from escaping. \nDuring your dreadful experience, you will meet beings called \"Shadows\", manifestations of your worst nightmares; you will have to subdue them as you continue wandering the darkness that envelopes you and, perhaps, you will achieve your freedom.\nBut Why is the Game Named This?\nInsanity is undoubtedly the main element: represented by the Shadow, it will encompass the entire story, haunt every frame, perhaps even disturb you own mind. It is from insanity, from foolishness, that the decay of mind begins. \nThe only way to oppose this deterioration is to piece together the fragments of Katherine's story; they are hidden in the vast maze in which you find yourself, look for them very carefully.",

            "desc": "Mind Unleashed is a first person Sci Fi shooter game specifically designed for Virtual Reality. You are a robot that is trying hard to survive in a secret military base, inside a rocky mountain. Rocks and futuristic stuff will surround you in this epic challenge where you'll need to survive as long as possible, fighting hordes of robotic enemies. Pick up very advanced weapons, take cover and wait the right time to destroy your enemy and play with strategy if you want to survive! In Mind Unleashed ARENA there are 15 waves of enemies to defeat in order to win. Each waves will be progressively harder with more robots and/or stronger robots with different weapons, aesthetics, speeds, damages, health and special abilities. Choose the class fit best your skills: Engineer, Assault or Specialist. Each skill offers its own play-style with 2 different abilities. If the player destroys all the enemies of a wave, an alarm will alert him that a new wave is going to be spawned. The player has 10 seconds before the new wave spawns. They can take advantage of this delay to find health packs, ammo etc. The main objective of the game is to reach the 15th wave of enemies and defeat the last boss.Of course the game will allow unlimited game play after victory. As other objectives that could help the player to accomplish the first, Special \"rooms\" are available that have inside 2 or more health packs and weapons for a quick restock. Since the game natively supports VR headsets like the Oculus Rift, we're making sure the game is as immersive as possible, motion sickness free and comfortable. We're adopting a smart UI system to make everything readable within the VR headsets. We also paying particular attention to make choices that perfectly fit and surprise the player while playing in VR. This means that we're trying to make the game as spectacular and interesting as possible, also on a visual side trying to encourage the player to explore each zone of the map and each area. The game is also optimized as much as possible to play perfectly smooth even on high demand VR headsets. Also, since the default controller for VR (Especially Oculus) is the Xbox game pad,we're fully supporting the Xbox 360/One game pad AND the keyboard+mouse. However, the game automatically detects if an headset is turned on or off and it will start the game accordingly. Features STRATEGIC / STEALTH OR AGGRESSIVE APPROACHES Play both with a more strategic / stealth approach or a more direct one. Beware that you'll be alone with waves of enemies, so in same cases be more silent could be a smart idea! DYNAMIC GROUND AND AERIAL COMBAT Hide between objects quietly or quickly fly in the air to destroy the enemies avoiding their shots, your choice! HIGHLY REPLAYABLE Re-playable almost ad infinitum, improve your previous performance and try to reach the next wave without dying. DEEP AND FUTURISTIC ATMOSPHERES Use your flash light if needed and enjoy this deep and futuristic atmosphere that will completely immerse you. 3 DIFFERENT AREAS 3 different areas to explore. You'll be able to unlock them going further through enemy waves. Each of them have its own different style. 3 DIFFERENT CLASSES Choose from 3 different classes: Engineer, Assault or Specialist and use their special abilities to let you destroy them all! BOSS AND DYNAMIC AIs Fight against different kinds of enemy waves with different AIs and pay particular attention to the bosses. You'll need to destroy them using more strategy and accuracy.",

You'll stimulate tree growth, choose a hue from the sky's breathtaking aurora display to customize your tranquil setting, and navigate the splendor of a lush forest floor—giving colorful life to the dark and sparse landscape. The soothing soundtrack, created by composer Susumu Yokota, evolves with your every interaction.\n\nLUMEN was created in collaboration with Walter Greenleaf, PhD, of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, and Framestore's VR Studio—and Dr. Greenleaf and other Stanford research scientists at the Lucille Packard Children's Hospital will be evaluating how LUMEN can help children who are undergoing difficult surgical procedures. The experience is just the tip of the interactive iceberg when it comes to the power of harnessing VR to better your life. \n\nTo exit LUMEN, look down until a panel of three buttons appears, then select the X by directing the gaze dot onto it.",

Then test  and improve your skills  with the fun but somewhat  realistic version of our professional ship simulator. Use your 4x2kW main engines and the bow and aft side thrusters to take your anchor handling and tug supply vessel (AHTS) out to the oil rig and hold it steady for 10 seconds, so your crew can rail in the anchor. But beware of the UFO and its tractor beam. If there is a fire, put it out before.. Adjustable weather conditions and two water guns that help against attacking aliens make it a fun experience with realistic controls. AHTS vessels are expensive, so try not to collide and sink it. \nWARNING:  The AHTS Simulator  is not for the faint and sea-sick.. In stormy weather conditions things may get uncomfortable... ",

            "title": "Ricerca VR",
            "desc": "Ricerca (ri-cher-ka), which in Italian means “search,” is an animated installation experience. In it, we follow a bicyclist searching through different memories and worlds to find something he has lost over time. This film was originally experienced on 5 different projection screens in an art gallery space with custom-designed 8 channel surround sound, and has since then been re-created virtually in order to showcase the art installation experience to more people with ease. Created by artist animator Yo-Yo Lin, Ricerca is a media installation that combines the virtues of cinematic storytelling with that of installation art, an experience designed to tell compelling stories in a more intimate format. Ricerca pushes boundaries in storytelling by creating a cinematic experience every viewer will experience and interpret differently by how they move around in space. The installation beckons viewers to physically move in and around the animated film and explore the three-dimensional soundscape in the room, giving viewers the ability to develop a highly personal relationship with the film and go on their own self-search through time. “Ricerca VR” is itself its own unique experience- instead of being in a room with other viewers, one goes on their own meditative journey in solitude. Just as in the physical art installation, the entire experience loops over after 12 minutes, giving the viewer opportunities to ruminate over the experience many times. The narrative is structured to have no clear beginning or end, drawing from the director’s Buddhist beliefs of reincarnation and flow of karmic energy. The sound design and musical score come together to create a directed experience in 360 space, allowing viewers to effectively follow a narrative on five screens by following certain hard sounds in different parts of the room. While there are directional sounds present to tell the viewer where to look, ambient sounds are spread throughout the room to create an immersive world for the viewer themselves to explore freely. Using Two Big Ear's 3Dception, our team effectively re-created our soundscape for Ricerca VR. While Ricerca VR is no game, it presents an interesting idea of how art installations can live on in virtual space, changing our perception of a temporal-based medium into one that has the potential to live on in a digital afterlife. Ricerca VR asks the questions, how will virtual reality be used to archive and distribute art? Will a virtual gallery system appear as the line between art and technology continue to be blurred? How can we foster the human experience that is integral in art-viewing with a medium like virtual reality? We hope Ricerca VR is a start to answering these questions.",

            "desc": "The future of power in the home...\n\nYou are gaining early access to a developing \"Learning Tool\" as well as a future \"Home Simulation Game\". \n\nWith the increasing cost of Electricity at home, we have tried to explain the next stage of Home Power Management. \n\nOur simulator explains how a home of the future (available now) will maintain usable electricity for the house owner, during night day and occasional blackouts. \n\nUsing a Solar and Battery setup.... the simulation shows how power flows from the Solar panels into a Solar Battery and is consumed by household appliances... \n\nAll of the components are configurable and we have tried to be as realistic as possible with all aspects. From the position of the sun in the sky down to the weather conditions. \n\nVery soon the Simulator will have a gaming component, where the player has to maintain the house as cheaply as possible and upgrade the house as money permits adding fun and teaching to how power is used in a real home. \n\nWe hope you will join us on the journey and help us create a useful informational VR experience. \n\nThanks ",

            "desc": "Please be noticed that this game does not support the Vive controllers. It requires a game pad or keyboard and mouse to play.\n\nUmihara Kawase is the name of our backpacking, Japanese, sushi chef heroine armed with a fishing rod, elastic fishing line, and a fishing hook. Face fish-like enemies, conveyor belts, spikes, watery pits, time travel and more. Collect items, and find your way to the end of each level. The deeper into this dream-like world that you venture, the more challenging the solutions and the greater the time pressure becomes. Along the way, look out for shortcuts and secret exits, and unlock bonus levels.\n\nThe elasticity of Umihara’s fishing line sets the Umihara Kawase Trilogy apart from other games, giving unprecedented levels of mobility and discovery. Tightening the line or giving lots of slack can be the difference between success or failure. The elastic nature of the fishing line allows the player to stretch down to otherwise unreachable areas or be catapulted upwards.\n\nFeatures\n- Physics-based puzzle/platforming that challenges your reflexes and brainpower\n- Extreme elastic fishing-line physics give you advanced control\n- Many stages with branching paths across three complete games\n- Four playable characters (in Sayonara Umihara Kawase)\n- Face giant, aquatic bosses like a tadpole, a seahorse, and more",

            "desc": "This game has not been test for Windows 8 compatibility. Please take this into consideration when making your purchase.\n\nThe Internet's tubes have been broken! Only you and your handpicked team can seal the tubes and save the Internet! VR Disc Golf is the first disc golf game with true disc throwing physics. Throw, chuck, and fly your way to victory through a virtual outrun environment. Play locally with up to four players in Party Mode. VR Disc Golf is the ultimate Vive party game. How great will your next VR party be?\n\nTrue Disc Physics\n\nVR Disc Golf is the first disc golf game for the Vive to have real disc physics! Complete physics simulations underlay all disc interactions, creating fun and unique game-play. Your disc realistically soars and bounces past each challenge. You can throw backhand, forehand (side arm), overhand (hammer throw) and just about everything else.\n\nSports Camera\n\nEver wanted to follow behind your disc after a particularly epic drive? Now you can! VR Disc Golf uses a cutting edge sports camera system to put you right in the action. Revolutionary camera controls leverage your body's natural tendency to move. You'll love seeing every bounce and wobble of your disc as you soar over the course, just like you've always wished you could! You can even switch your disc mid-flight for advanced game-play to influence the outcome like you've always wanted!\n\nSingle Player\n\nVR Disc Golf launches with one outrun themed 18-hole course. Intense game-play awaits as you explore each hand crafted hole's particular challenge. Your throwing arm will be put to the maximum test by black holes, lakes of burning lava, spinning obstacles, and other denizens of the deep Internet. True disc physics provides limitless replay value.\n\nParty Mode - Local Multiplayer\n\nWhat could be better than playing VR Disc Golf by yourself? Playing with friends and family of course! Party Mode (only one virtual reality headset required) allows you to play competitive rounds of disc golf with up to four local players. The game accommodates HMD sharing by keeping track of whose turn it is, and reminding you to switch players when the time is right.\n\nMusic\n\nWith over 40 music tracks you'll never hear a boring sound! Music created by Deceased Superior Technician. Thanks for the awesome music!\n\nWARNING: VR Disc Golf uses a sports camera that rotates your view around the disc based on the direction you are facing. Take your time getting used to the sports camera and it will provide a naturally immersive locomotion experience. If you feel any motion sickness you can turn off the sports camera from in-game options.",

You will fight against the wind to fly, monitor the battery charge and avoid crashing into objects to prevent damage which could lead your copter to failure. Currently, the game has many features such as - going fishing, racing, golf, shooting cannon balls into the goal and carrying objects from A to B all while controlling your drone! The game is built within Unreal Engine 4, which brings excellent physics which makes drone control more difficult, and brings a nice touch to realism as you play. In it's current state, the game is ready for release. Updates are not guaranteed, but if the game becomes popular enough we plan to add customisation options to your drone and possibly more levels, gamemodes and more. \n\nHere is a simplified list of what Copter and Sky has to offer currently:- \n\n1. Real input controls with gamepad support. \n2. Custom camera; Third person, first person, cinematic. \n3. Golf, Fishing, Racing, Obstacle Courses, Shooting and more. \n4. Lovely graphics and realistic lighting and maps; day and night cycle. \n5. Friendly support. \n6. Guarantee for fun if you enjoy flying drones.",

Now you can, with your new friend Olaf S9.\n\nAnno 1500 is a time travel adventure that takes you back to the late 1500s and the township of Luleå in the north of Sweden. On a barren place simply called The Mountain preparations for a church holiday are well under way. People here speak several different languages and dialects. You get to meet three characters who represent three branches of a multicultural society. Luleå parish, from mountain to coast, has about 3000 inhabitants. Gustav Vasa's son — John III — is the king of Sweden. The shift from Catholicism to Protestantism is still very recent. The people of this parish come to the church town to attend mass, trade and pay taxes.\n\nNo one lives here, except occasionally during these visits. The port has already moved further out into the bay due to the uplift but the city of Luleå is still founded here in 1621. Some citizens are forced to move here but the vast majority still live in neighboring villages. The shallow bay will soon make it impossible for ships to enter and Luleå is then moved to its current location. What remains here is known as Gammelstad — Church Town — a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996.",

            "desc": "**Be sure to also check out MakeVR Pro, available now on Viveport**\n\nMake your imagination real with MakeVR and HTC VIVE, only on Viveport.\n\nMakeVR is a 3D content creation experience with a natural style of interaction that lets anyone, regardless of age or experience level, step into a professional CAD engine and start building cool 3D objects and worlds on Day One.  MakeVR democratizes content creation through its extremely low learning curve because you use your own two hands as they were meant to be used, with very natural and intuitive interactions.\n\n3D Multi-Touch\n\nWith two independently tracked hands in MakeVR, you can translate (move), scale, and rotate your environment in the same way you use 2D multi-touch on your smartphone, or tablet – but better. You simply reach out and grab a point in space and use that point to drag the entire world around: up, down, left, right, backward, and forward. If you grab two points, you can move your hands closer or further apart to scale the environment up or down and rotate it around you. Scaling in MakeVR is a powerful feature because it allows you to position yourself anywhere in the environment at whatever scale best suits the current task – so you’re always working in your comfort zone.\n\nMakeVR’s 3D Multi-Touch is the next logical step in the evolution of interfaces, the perfect interface for the next generation of users who already expect a greater level of interaction. It’s a way of interacting with 3D content that is so natural and intuitive anyone can do it.\n\nBuilt-in CAD engine for precision and a life beyond MakeVR\n\nMakeVR may be fun, but it's more than just a toy.  Because it incorporates a professional CAD engine, you have all the advanced tools you expect, presented in a way anyone can understand and use.\n\nThere are other immersive creation applications on the market, but while they are strong on freeform modeling, they lack the ability to work with precision. Combining an industry standard CAD engine with 3D Multi-Touch, we’ve developed a powerful yet easy to use way to build precision models while immersed.  This allows MakeVR to benefit the professional modeler as well. \n\nAnd anything you create in MakeVR can be exported -- to share with others, to import into other applications, or to be 3D printed.\n\n3D printing for everyone\n\nMakeVR is a 3D modeling design system for virtual reality that fully supports all major 3D printing platforms.  And everything created in MakeVR can be saved in any standard 3D printing format, and with a click of a button, sent to either a local 3D printer or to a 3D printing service like Shapeways.\n\nWith MakeVR, the old challenges of 3D modeling are gone. It frees you from the constraints of complicated, traditional menu-based modeling programs. Imagine being able to physically reach into a 3D scene to grab, interact with, and modify CAD-based solid models just like you manipulate objects in the real world. Now imagine, with the click of a button, sending your creation to a local 3D printer or to a printing service to bring it into the real world. MakeVR allows you to do all of this and more.",

            "desc": "Jenga was originally developed to be a game that tests your hand-eye coordination and three dimensional thinking skills. Now we are happy to announce that the age old game has received local Vive support, giving birth to JengaVR! \tCool Features: \tIntristic design-Fully utilizing the Unity engine, JengaVR transports the players into a surreal mountain setting where they are greeted with a scene of trees and hills, accompanied by an immersive audio visual experience. JengaVR is also the first VR application in the world to feature a display icon drawn completely in Google Tilt Brush!\t\t\nSingle player Practice-Players here are free to explore the many possibilities and play styles that come with Jenga. With no pressure, feel free to practice all you want, finding that perfect balance between success and collapse.\t\tMultiplayer VS-Hosted on a local area network,players here are able to play with their friends and put their skills to the test as the face off in an intense battle, resulting in glorious victory, or utter defeat. Players take turns removing blocks, creating an ever increasing but also constantly unstable tower until it all crumbles to the ground.\t\t\nAny and all opinions and criticisms are warmly appreciated!",

The debut episode, featuring an incredible close encounter with an 80 foot whale, is already recognized as one the most iconic room scale VR experiences to date (a Sundance Film Festival 2016 selection). Additional episodes in this bundle take place on a teeming coral reef and in the very deepest region of the ocean. Gain access to new modes of discovery in each episode. Slow time and capture pictures in Inspector Mode, and return to a meditative version of each location in Ambient Mode. The first three episodes of theBlu, contained in this bundle, are: Whale Encounter: An undersea encounter with the largest species on earth. Reef Migration: Witness the magnificence of an undersea migration on the edge of a coral reef. Luminous Abyss: Venture into the deepest region of the ocean to discover the iridescent abyss.",

Kate and her film projector, the Magic Lantern, are waiting for you in the virtual room, ready to whisk you away on a captivating journey. Just choose a story and start the projector!\n\nOur stories are well-known around the world, and have been specially adapted for preschool-aged children. These are tales that have stood the test of time, and they offer important life lessons about being kind, understanding and helpful, having courage, and doing the right thing.\n\nAnd if you don’t feel like watching a story, there are plenty of other things to do here!\n\nDETAILS:\n- Watch beautifully told, uplifting stories, treasured by generations of children: Alice in Wonderland, The War of the Worlds, Little Mowgli, Gulliver in the Country of the Lilliputians, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Captain Fracassie, Many Miles Under the Sea and Treasure Island!\n - Explore the room and rearrange objects any way you like. The size of your actual room won’t limit you. You can play Magic Lantern VR wherever you are.\n- Turn off gravity and see what happens when ordinary objects become weightless – you can’t do that in a real-life playroom!\n- Darts, balls, toy cars, blocks, stuffed animals, a globe and pictures appear in the game as interactive objects – toys you can play with but never break or lose.\n- Draw on the easel and let your imagination run free – your paint will never dry out, and your clothes won’t get dirty.\n- Shoot soap bubbles from a cool bubble gun.\n- Try controlling a toy cat, directing it using a laser pointer.\n- Choose another language in the game setup for a fun way to learn a foreign language.\n\nNow you have a new playroom, cozy and safe, where children can do almost anything they want and never get hurt. \n\nHome is where the magic begins!\n",

Although this last mile may vary depending on feedback from the community, this is what you can expect : \n\n- 2 additionnal levels : a motel courtyard shootout and an outdoor level ; \n- more weapons to choose from ; \n- additionnal skins and equipement for enemies ; \n- new game modes : tower defence, waves, rescue, career... and more as tell us how you would like to play! \n\n\nDo not hesitate to share your comments and suggestions, so Fast Action Hero can remain the best shooter game on your favorite headset!\"\nWhat is the current state of the Early Access version?\n\"- 1 destructible level in survival mode with 5 cover points ; \n- 3 weapons modes : dual wield revolvers, dual submachine gun, or a two handed AK47 ; \n- 2 types of enemies with 4 variations each anda mix of 6 weapons (handgun, shotgun, uzi, mp5, ak, m16) ; \n- Adjustable difficulty : arcade to realistic impacting your health, bullet time speed, reload time and enemy precision. \n\n- Local and cross platform Co-op: let your friends control the wave on the screen or on their phones, spawning and moving enemies in to corner you in real time; \n- Leaderboards : local / friends / worldwide. \n\nAnd of course a lot of fun !!!\"\nWill the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?\n\"We plan to gradually raise the price as we ship new content and features.\"\nHow are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?\n\"We want to build our roadmap based on feedbacks from our community.\"\n\n\nRoom scale VR gaming experience - HTC Vive required",

            "desc": "Annie Amber – A life captured as a VR Puzzle Game\n\n\nWHEN VIRTUAL REALITY LETS YOU FEEL A (VIRTUAL) REAL LIFE\nAnnie Amber is a VR puzzle game that leads you on an intense and dreamy journey through the life of a person condensed in a surreal and poetic experience. With innovative controls, AA makes you explore this strange and beautiful scenery that is life itself while using your wit to make your way through different memories. \n\nLIFE IS POETRY, SO IS ANNIE AMBER\nBut the life of Annie Amber isn’t told you in a plain way. Memories are symbolic, fragmented and complex, so the journey will be full of subtle beauty and poetry. Through sad and powerful piano tracks, youwill solve puzzles that will slowly unlock Annie Amber’s memories. The result is a game as minimalistic as intense: overwhelmed by huge celestial bodies, we will get to know and understand Annie Amber (fictional character) as if she were a close friend of us. \n\n\nUSE YOUR MOTION CONTROLLERS!\nAnnie Amber is meant to be player with motion controllers. Use them to travel and interact with the environment and the puzzle elements. On the other hand, if you don't have motion controllers you can still play the game activating the mode without motion controllers. This innovative system matches the minimalistic and subtle approach of the whole game, while enhancing the immersion of the player. With no external controllers at all (aside from your hands or your head), the player will be a silent explorer while also being able of experiencing VR at its fullest. \n\n\nWELCOME TO VIRTUAL REALITY\nThe universality of its narrative and the accessibility of its innovative controlling system make Annie Amber not only a product for all kinds of audience, but also an excellent introduction to virtual reality and videogames. A whole new world of possibilities is about to emerge from this technology, and Annie Amber is a beautiful and intuitive way of embracing it for the first time while also being good enough for VR pros.",

            "desc": "For each caught egg the player is given one point. First, the eggs roll slowly, but the pace of the game is accelerating gradually. Every 20 and 30 scored points the pace of the game slows down a bit. \n\nIn the case the egg falls, the player is given a penalty point, which is indicated by a chicken - it will appear on the box on your right. If it occurs in the presence of a kitten, which appears in the box on your left, then the player is given a half of the penalty point - on the box on your right appears an egg instead of the chicken. \n\nEvery 20 and 30 of caught eggs the penalty points will be cancelled. After receiving three penalty points (from three to six eggs fell down), the game stops. \n\nThe game has two difficulty levels and mode Time Attack. In the simple mode, the eggs start to roll only by three trays at the same time. In the hard mode on all four trays and the fourth tray is located behind you! \n\nIn Time Attack mode eggs will roll by 3 trays for three minutes, every second quicker – you should lose as few eggs as possible. \n\nTest your dexterity! Catch as many eggs as you can!",
